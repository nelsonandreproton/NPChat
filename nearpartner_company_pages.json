It uses visual interfaces and pre-built components, for faster development without the need for deep programming knowledge. The focus is on simplifying the process while maintaining flexibility and functionality.\n\nIs Python a low-code?\n\nNo, Python is not considered a low-code language. It’s a general-purpose programming language that requires manual coding for development. While Python is known for its simplicity and readability, it still requires a solid understanding of programming principles to build applications, unlike low-code platforms that minimize the amount of coding required.\n\nWhat is low-code vs normal code?\n\nLow-code development simplifies traditional software development by using visual tools and drag-and-drop features, reducing the need for extensive manual coding. Normal (or traditional) coding, on the other hand, involves writing custom code from scratch, requiring a deeper understanding of programming languages and development frameworks.\n\nIs low-code easy to learn?\n\nYes, low-code platforms are generally easier to learn compared to traditional coding. They are designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, featuring visual development environments that allow users to create applications with little to no coding. While basic familiarity with logic and design principles is helpful, the learning curve is much lower than traditional programming languages.\n\nLow-code development\n\nLow-code platforms allows businesses to quickly build, deploy, and scale applications with far less complexity than traditional development methods. We help you create custom solutions that address your specific needs — from improving customer engagement to optimizing internal processes.\n\nAs an OutSystems partner, we work alongside you to implement low-code technology that fits your business. Whether you’re modernizing legacy systems or launching new applications, our team provides the flexibility and speed required to stay competitive. We focus on delivering real results with minimal disruption to your existing workflows.\n\nLet’s move beyond the traditional development approach. With Low-code, you get the speed, security, and scalability you need to push your business forward.",

When they aren’t, both learn and adjust. It’s fair, accountable, and focused on what actually drives growth.\n\nLet’s talk\n\nwhy it matters?\n\nTraditional partnerships reward effort. Risk sharing rewards outcomes.\n\nClear goals from day one\n\n. Shared KPIs mean full alignment. No mixed signals or shifting priorities.\n\nReal accountability.\n\nBoth teams track the same metrics, so performance is visible and measurable at every stage.\n\nFaster course correction\n\n. Regular evaluation windows mean we can adapt before issues scale.\n\nShared motivation.\n\nWhen success is mutual, collaboration becomes sharper and strategic.\n\nhow it works?\n\nAt Near Partner, risk sharing follows a clear, structured flow:\n\n1.

The moment both sides commit to the same KPIs, you feel the partnership tighten. It’s the closest thing to real alignment I’ve seen in our industry.”\n\nSérgio de Melo Cunha\n\nCCO Near Partner\n\nLet’s talk\n\nFAQ about risk sharing model\n\nHere are the answers you need before making the call.\n\nDoes risk sharing mean higher costs?\n\nNot necessarily. You pay based on results, not effort. When goals are met, both sides benefit, making it a smarter investment over time.\n\nHow do you measure performance?\n\nWe agree on specific KPIs and baselines before the project starts. Then, we track them transparently throughout execution.\n\nWhat happens if goals aren’t met?\n\nThe model is built for learning as much as for success. If targets aren’t achieved, we review the data together, adjust the approach, and move forward aligned.\n\nIs risk sharing suitable for all types of projects?\n\nIt works best for initiatives with clear, quantifiable goals, like digital transformation, process automation, performance optimisation, and similar strategic areas.\n\nWhat makes Near Partner’s model different?\n\nOur process is transparent from day one. We define success together, validate impact jointly, and share the outcome, accountability included.\n\nLet’s talk outcomes",
