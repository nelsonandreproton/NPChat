    "content": "Discover when to modernise or replace your legacy system, and how to make the right move for lasting business impact.\n\nEvery company has (at least) one – a legacy system that’s too old to love, too critical to replace.\n\nIt runs your core operations, stores years of valuable data, and somehow still holds the business together. Yet every new integration feels like a small act of engineering heroism, every upgrade a gamble between “it might work” and “we might break everything.”\n\nLegacy systems are how your company has operated for years, and that’s exactly why changing them is so complicated. Even the thought of replacing them seems daunting. However, it may be key to reduce costs and risks, while speeding daily operations.\n\nThe real question isn’t how old your system is. It’s whether it’s still helping your business move forward. So before committing to a complete overhaul, take a step back. You might not need a brand-new system. Just the right approach to make your existing one smarter, faster, and ready for what’s next. And that’s exactly what this guide explores.\n\nWhat is a legacy system?\n\nA legacy system is essentially an older software or IT setup that a business keeps running because it still “does the job”, even if it’s creaky, hard to update, and sometimes feels like it’s stuck in the past. These systems often hold critical data, support essential operations, and are deeply woven into how a company functions. While they may be reliable, they can slow down innovation, complicate integrations, and make scaling a headache.\n\nThere’s no age threshold to call any piece of software a legacy system. They show up in all sorts of forms across businesses, like old software or even entire IT infrastructures that have been around for decades. Some common examples include:\n\nERP platforms\n\n. They handle core processes like finance, HR, and\n\nsupply chain\n\n, but often require custom workarounds just to keep them talking to newer tools.\n\nCustom-built CRM software\n\n. Designed years ago for very specific workflows, they can struggle to scale as\n\ncustomer needs\n\nevolve or as new channels appear.\n\nOutdated reporting tools\n\n. Many companies still rely on old\n\ndashboards\n\nor Excel-heavy systems that demand manual updates, making real-time insights almost impossible.\n\nOld communication platforms\n\n. Legacy email, intranet, or messaging systems that lack modern collaboration features, slowing down teams who are used to sleek, intuitive tools.\n\nWhy you probably still rely on legacy systems\n\nEven though legacy systems can be clunky, costly to maintain, and a headache for modernisation, you probably choose to keep them alive for a number of very practical reasons:\n\nThey’re critical to operations\n\n. Many legacy systems run the backbone of a company, from finance to customer data. Even small changes may require extensive testing.\n\nHigh replacement cost\n\n. Upgrading or replacing a legacy system can feel like buying a small spaceship: expensive, complex, and time-consuming.\n\nData entanglement\n\n. Years of business data live inside these systems.\n\nMigrating it safely\n\nis a careful, delicate process.\n\nFamiliarity\n\n. Teams have learned the quirks, workarounds, and patterns of these systems over years. Change can be scary and slow to adopt.\n\nRegulatory or compliance constraints\n\n. In sectors like banking or healthcare, legacy systems often meet strict requirements that new tools haven’t been certified for yet.\n\nProblems caused by a legacy system (and how to fix them)\n\nLegacy systems can feel like both a safety net and a trap. They keep operations running, but they also create a set of predictable, yet painful, challenges.\n\n1. Slow innovation\n\nLegacy systems often can’t keep up with new technologies, integrations, or customer expectations. Adding new features can take months instead of days. In fact,\n\n70% of top executives\n\nsay legacy systems limit their ability to innovate.\n\nHow to fix\n\n: Introduce modular tools or APIs that wrap around the legacy system. This lets you modernise workflows without ripping everything out at once.\n\n2. High maintenance costs\n\nOrganisations frequently discover that vast chunks of their IT budget disappear just to keep the lights on: some studies show up to\n\n70% or more\n\nof spending goes into maintaining legacy systems, leaving little fuel for real change.\n\nHow to fix:\n\nConduct a system audit to identify which parts are truly critical. Consider phased replacement or cloud migration for the components that drain resources.\n\n3. Data bottlenecks and silos\n\nImportant data is locked in old formats, making reporting, analytics, and decision-making slow or inaccurate.\n\nHow to fix:\n\nImplement a\n\ndata integration\n\nlayer or ETL (extract, transform, load) processes. Slowly consolidate key data into a modern, accessible platform.\n\n4. Security vulnerabilities\n\nOlder systems are often unsupported, missing patches, and more exposed to breaches.\n\nHow to fix:\n\nStrengthen perimeter security, apply virtual patches where possible, and plan for a\n\ngradual migration\n\nto systems that are actively maintained.\n\n5. Employee frustration and inefficiency\n\nTeams adapt with workarounds, which leads to errors, delays, and burnout.\n\nHow to fix:\n\nProvide modern interfaces or dashboards on top of the legacy system, and invest in targeted training so employees can work smarter.\n\nWhen you don’t need to replace a legacy system\n\nLegacy systems get a bad rap. Everyone tells you to replace them, yet in many cases, throwing the baby out with the bathwater is neither necessary nor smart. Here’s when\n\nkeeping (and modernising) your legacy system\n\nis actually the right move:\n\n1. It still does the job (reliability matters)\n\nOld doesn’t always mean broken. If your legacy system consistently supports critical operations without frequent downtime, it’s providing real value. Instead of replacing it, focus on optimising processes around it. Small tweaks, better reporting layers, or workflow improvements can significantly extend its usefulness. Sometimes stability is more valuable than shiny new features.\n\n2. Modern integration is possible\n\nMany legacy systems weren’t built with modern integrations in mind, but clever workarounds exist. You can wrap APIs, add dashboards, or\n\nautomate data flows\n\naround your old system. This lets you leverage new tech (analytics, cloud storage, mobile access) without dismantling the infrastructure that still works. You get modern capabilities without the cost and risk of a full replacement.\n\n3. It holds critical data\n\nLegacy systems often hold years of business-critical data. Extracting, cleaning, and migrating this information can be risky, time-consuming, and costly. Incremental modernisation allows you to maintain the\n\nintegrity of your data\n\nwhile gradually improving accessibility, reporting, and decision-making capabilities.\n\n5. It complies with regulations\n\nIn industries like finance, healthcare, or government, legacy systems often meet stringent regulatory standards. Swapping them out can introduce compliance risks. Modernisation, on the other hand, allows you to add functionality, reporting, or security upgrades while maintaining compliance, keeping operations smooth and worry-free.\n\nLegacy system modernization or replacement?\n\nThere’s no universal answer. The right path depends on your business goals, how critical the system is, and how much risk (and disruption) you can afford. What you need isn’t a gut decision. It’s a strategy.\n\nIt starts with understanding how critical the system is to your operations and whether it’s truly holding you back. Sometimes, modernisation delivers quick wins (lower costs, minimal disruption, and faster results), especially when the system is stable but outdated. Replacement, on the other hand, makes sense when performance issues, security risks, or scalability limits are too severe to patch over.\n\nThe smartest move is often a hybrid one: modernise what brings immediate value, and plan replacement where it aligns with long-term goals. Consider costs beyond the technology itself, like training, adoption, and downtime matter just as much. By combining a phased approach with a clear strategic vision, you can evolve your systems at the right pace, keeping business continuity while building the foundation for future growth.\n\nHow to update legacy systems\n\n1. Initiate with a focused assessment\n\nInventory the system: functions it supports, data it holds, external integrations, compliance constraints, and current costs (maintenance + incidents). Score each component on business criticality, change risk, and technical debt.\n\n2. Define business outcomes and success metrics\n\nTranslate technical work into business KPIs: uptime improvement, lead time to deploy, reporting latency, cost reduction, user satisfaction, regulatory reporting accuracy. These metrics will drive prioritisation.\n\n3. Design a layered migration strategy\n\nChoose an approach per component: wrap (API façade), refactor (incremental code improvements), replatform (move to cloud), or replace. For each, define scope, dependencies, rollback plan and estimated effort.\n\n4. Secure quick wins\n\nImplement low-risk changes that deliver immediate value: add an API gateway, create a reporting data extract, build a user dashboard, or automate a manual process. Quick wins free budget and build trust.\n\n5. Prototype and validate\n\nBuild a small, production-adjacent and validate with real users and real data slices. Measure against the KPIs set in step 2. Use feature flags and canary releases to limit exposure.\n\n6. Plan data migration carefully\n\nMap schemas, define transformation rules, validate data quality, and run dry-runs. Use incremental sync (CDC/ETL) where possible so both systems can run in parallel. Always have a verified rollback snapshot.\n\n7. Implement integration and observability\n\nAdd monitoring, logging, and tracing before cutover. Implement health checks and automated alerts. Observability reduces blast radius during deployment.\n\n8. Run staged rollout and parallel running\n\nStart with a pilot business unit or region, run systems in parallel, compare outputs, and iterate. Only widen the rollout once reliability and data parity are proven.\n\n9. Cutover, switch traffic, and stabilise\n\nUse phased traffic shifts (e.g., 1% – 10% – 50% – 00%) and keep the legacy system available as a fallback for a defined period. Maintain a battle-plan: rollback steps, communication scripts, and a small on-call war room.\n\n10. Post-launch review and continuous improvement\n\nMeasure against KPIs, collect user feedback, fix gaps, and document lessons learned. Close or archive legacy components following a final decommission checklist (data retention, compliance, backups).\n\nStart your legacy system migration with Near Partner\n\nModernising a legacy system is a strategic decision that can redefine how your business operates. The real challenge is knowing when to modernise, when to replace, and how to do it without disrupting what already works. That’s where expertise makes the difference.\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we help companies see beyond the surface, assessing whether their legacy systems need a complete rebuild or simply a smart, phased upgrade.

    "content": "Learn how to choose an AI assistant that actually delivers value, with examples, pitfalls, and insights from real-world implementations.\n\nOnly about\n\n5% of workers\n\nfeel they’re getting meaningful results from AI. That means the overwhelming majority are either underutilizing these tools, misusing them, or (worse), treating them as glorified toys that generate a little buzz but no real impact.\n\nSome may think it’s a technology problem, but it’s more a human and strategic one. Installing an AI assistant isn’t enough. Without careful integration, proper training, and clear objectives, even the most sophisticated AI becomes little more than a fancy desk ornament: flashy, talked about at meetings, but fundamentally useless.\n\nIn this article, we’ll unpack what it really takes to make an AI assistant deliver value.\n\nWhat are AI assistants?\n\nAI assistants are digital tools that help you get work done faster and more accurately. They read information, process tasks, summarise content, draft messages, analyse data, keep track of what matters, and support decisions with context-aware suggestions. Tools like\n\nChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot or Google Gemini\n\nadapt to your workflows, follow the rules you define, and integrate seamlessly into the way you already work.\n\nIf you receive a long client report, an AI assistant can instantly summarise the key insights, pull out action points, draft an email response, update your project tracker in tools like Notion or Slack, and remind you of upcoming deadlines — all without you switching between applications.\n\nWhat is the difference between AI assistants and AI agents?\n\nSimply put, AI assistants help you complete tasks, while\n\nAI agents\n\nhelp you run them.\n\nAssistants wait for your input, like a prompt, a question, a file, an instruction. They support your workflow, but you’re still in the driver’s seat.\n\nAI agents operate with more autonomy. You give them a goal, they break it down, decide what to do next, execute steps on their own, check the results, adjust, and keep going until the job is done.\n\nWhy AI assistants make work more productive\n\nWhen implemented thoughtfully, AI assistants are like adding a team member who never sleeps, never complains, and actually enjoys doing the wearying stuff no one else wants.\n\n1. They save (a lot of) time\n\nAI assistants handle the low-value, repetitive chores, like scheduling meetings, chasing updates, sending reminders or summarising reports. People spend less time on “busy work” and more time on creativity, decision-making, and problem-solving. In other words: productivity levels go up, stress levels go down.\n\n2. They save money\n\nAI assistants work 24/7, handle multiple requests at once, and don’t need coffee breaks. That’s a round-the-clock operation for a fraction of the cost of hiring extra staff. They reduce operational expenses while keeping customers and internal teams happy.\n\n3. They can get personal\n\nAI assistants can analyse behaviours, preferences, and past interactions to deliver advice, recommendations, or responses that feel tailor-made. Whether suggesting the right product, sending relevant updates, or providing context-aware support, the assistant makes interactions feel smarter and more human, without anyone having to micromanage it.\n\nLimitations of AI assistants\n\nAs you probably already know by using AI tools, they can make mistakes… they may misread a request, hallucinate a confident nonsense answer, or treat a niche scenario like it’s a global rule.\n\nAI assistants only look smart because they’ve been fed oceans of data. But if those oceans are polluted (biased, outdated, overly niche, or missing entire user groups), the outcomes will reflect that. Skewed training data can create blind spots, unfair recommendations, and results that simply miss the mark.\n\nIf you want a high-performing assistant, you need to invest in the plumbing: data pipelines, validation rules, ownership, and ongoing maintenance. Otherwise, expect mediocre insights wrapped in confident sentences.\n\nBut even with clean data, reliable AI assistants are a challenge. After all, natural language is full of nuance, ambiguity and cultural context. And humans are experts at being vague. (“Can you sort this out?”, “Make it better”, “Handle the thing we discussed”.)\n\nIf your workflows require complex reasoning or domain-specific reading comprehension, evaluate assistants aggressively. The limitations appear fast.\n\nAnd then there’s data security. AI assistants often access sensitive information, such as financials, customer data, internal documents, strategic decisions. If the assistant isn’t backed by proper encryption, access controls, audit logs, and regular updates, you’re handing your organisation’s crown jewels to a system that may or may not be lock-tight.\n\nHow to choose the right AI assistant\n\nHere’s how to pick an assistant that actually earns its keep.\n\n1. Start from outcomes\n\nBe specific about the result you expect. Features are worthless without context. So, translate vague wishes into measurable outcomes:\n\n2. Define the AI assistant’s guardrails\n\nYou should be able to set clear guardrails to the AI assistant, like block certain actions or require approvals. For example, you may want to define on which apps the assistant can work on. It should also respect your governance rules (like access control).\n\n3. Evaluate transparency and control\n\nYou need explanations and control knobs. Can the assistant show why it suggested what it did? Can you correct it and have it learned?\n\n4. Test with messy, real scenarios\n\nIf it only shines with “clean” demo data, it won’t survive your day-to-day. Test the assistant with a real ticket that took a long time to resolve or your actual monthly report dataset (with messy fields).\n\n5. Set KPIs for you AI assistant\n\nJust like you would do for any other team member, AI assisntants need KPIs, too. Track\n\ntime saved, adoption rate and accuracy.\n\n6. Involve your (human) team\n\nYour teams need to\n\nlike\n\nusing it. If the assistant feels slow, inflexible, or overly formal, adoption drops. Appoint an enthusiastic, credible sponsor from the business. Train real users on how to use the assistant and what to do when it fails.\n\nAI assistants worth knowing (and what they do well)\n\nBefore choosing an AI assistant, it helps to look at what’s already out there. Below are a few examples that show how different approaches to AI can build momentum.\n\n1. Microsoft Copilot\n\nA productivity assistant woven into the Microsoft ecosystem. Ideal for organisations whose workdays revolve around Office 365 or Teams. And it works where people already work, meaning almost no onboarding pain.\n\nWhat it does well\n\nOrganizes meetings with structured summaries and action points.\n\nHelps draft emails and documents without sounding like an instruction manual.\n\nSurfaces insights buried across Outlook, Teams, and SharePoint.\n\nReduces the time you waste searching for “that file someone shared last Tuesday”.\n\n2. Perplexity AI\n\nBest for people who spend their day researching, comparing options, and trying to get reliable answers fast—without juggling twenty tabs or manually checking every source.\n\nWhat it does well\n\nPulls together clear, concise answers with high-quality citations so you always know where the information comes from.\n\nBreaks down complex topics into digestible summaries, even when you’re not sure how to frame the question.\n\nSurfaces real-time, web-based insights without you having to hunt for them.\n\nFits naturally into research-heavy workflows, making it easy to compile findings, create reports, and keep everything organised.\n\n3. Notion AI\n\nA favourite among fast-moving teams who want structure without bureaucracy. It works inside Notion, turning knowledge bases, project pages, and meeting notes into living, searchable systems.\n\nWhat it does well\n\nCreates summaries and action lists from messy notes.\n\nConverts half-baked ideas into organised project pages.\n\nHelps maintain team knowledge without needing a “documentation champion”.\n\nExtends Notion’s modular system with genuinely useful automation.\n\n4. Salesforce Einstein Copilot\n\nThe\n\nAI layer that sits inside Salesforce\n\nand makes all that CRM data work for you. Best for sales, service, and marketing teams who spend half their lives clicking through tabs.\n\nWhat it does well\n\nSuggests next-best actions based on real pipeline data.\n\nDrafts messages, follow-ups, and case responses directly inside the CRM.\n\nSurfaces insights about accounts, deals, sentiment, and conversion risk.\n\nAutomates CRM updates (so reps actually keep the CRM up to date).\n\n5. OutSystems AI Copilot\n\nFor organisations building apps at speed,\n\nOutSystems’ AI features\n\nhelp teams design, develop, and deploy faster, without forcing developers to hunt for documentation.\n\nWhat it does well\n\nGenerates application logic, screens, and workflows from natural language prompts.\n\nSpots performance issues or bad architecture early, before they become expensive.\n\nSpeeds up low-code development without compromising quality.\n\nAssists both technical and non-technical users in building functional prototypes quickly.\n\nMake AI assistants work for you with Near Partner\n\nMost organisations are struggling because they’ve never had an assistant built around their reality. The gap between “we’re experimenting with AI” and “AI is driving measurable impact” is almost always the same: thoughtful design, solid integration, and a partner who knows how to turn good intentions into working systems.\n\nWe help companies move past generic tools and build AI assistants that understand their workflows, speak their language, and deliver results people can feel in their day-to-day work.\n\nIf you’re ready to turn AI into a competitive advantage,\n\ntalk to us\n\n.

    "content": "Low-code automation helps organisations simplify complex workflows. But is the process as simple as it seems? Here’s how they’re making it work.\n\nSlow approvals, redundant data entry, juggling multiple systems to complete simple tasks — if you were to list the most frustrating admin headaches, these would likely top it. And it’s no surprise. Early automation solutions promised sweeping productivity gains across everything from client proposals to expense management — yet conveniently glossed over long implementation times, steep learning curves, and inflexible systems.\n\nStill, automation remains a vital need for businesses of all sizes. Which leads to a key question:\n\nwhat’s the most efficient way to automate repetitive processes today?\n\nEnter\n\nlow-code automation\n\n— an approach that lets teams build automations through drag-and-drop interfaces and by connecting the tools they already use. But is it a truly practical alternative? And how does it complement the growing wave of\n\nAI-powered automation\n\n?\n\nWhat is low-code automation?\n\nLow-code automation uses visual interfaces, pre-built components, and just enough coding to allow both IT and business teams to build applications and automate processes faster and more efficiently.\n\nIn practice, it’s about connecting actions that used to be manual and time-consuming. For example:\n\nWhen a customer places an order, the system automatically updates inventory, triggers an invoice, and sends a personalised confirmation — no manual entry needed.\n\nWhen a new support ticket arrives, it’s automatically classified, assigned to the right team member, and added to a dashboard for real-time tracking.\n\nWhen an email with a specific request is received, the content is extracted, logged into a database, and linked to an open project task — all without human intervention.\n\nLow-code\n\nautomation removes unnecessary friction and makes space for speed, agility, and collaboration. It’s a response to a long-standing problem: innovation bottlenecked by technical debt and overloaded IT departments.\n\nWhy low-code automation matters\n\nSimply put, because speed, resilience and adaptability became basic corporate skills.\n\nLess IT intensive\n\nIn most organisations, IT teams are overworked. That means new solutions often take months. Low-code automation allows non-technical teams to design and launch simple workflows themselves, using intuitive visual tools instead of complex programming. For straightforward tasks, this empowers business users to act quickly without waiting for IT queues to clear. But when it comes to building more complex, integrated, or large-scale solutions — the kind that truly transform how an organisation operates — having expert support makes all the difference.\n\nEliminate manual work and repetitive tasks\n\nNo one enjoys spending hours copying data from one system to another or chasing for approvals. These tasks eat up time, create bottlenecks, and increase the chance of error. Low-code automation takes those repeatable steps — like sending notifications, logging entries, or routing requests — and runs them in the background. Consistently, and instantly.\n\nReduce errors and operational risk\n\nMistakes don’t just slow things down — they cost money and damage trust. Especially when they’re caused by manual data entry or inconsistent processes. Automation brings structure and consistency, ensuring the right steps happen in the right order, every time.\n\nHow to get started: a step-by-step guide for business leaders\n\nYou don’t need to be technical to make low-code automation work. What you need is clarity, alignment and the right use cases. Here’s how to begin.\n\n1. Pick one process to start with\n\nPick a high-impact process that happens frequently and involves clear, defined steps.\n\nFocus on tasks like expense approvals, client intake, or task assignment.\n\nEnsure the process involves no more than 5 people to avoid complexity.\n\nStart small to avoid getting overwhelmed.\n\n2. Map it out with the people who do it\n\nUnderstand the process from end-to-end with those who do it daily.\n\nList steps and pain points with the people that actually use the process every day.\n\nCreate a simple process map, highlighting triggers, actions, and approvals.\n\nIdentify bottlenecks or repetitive tasks that are ideal for automation.\n\n3. Choose a low-code platform that fits your needs\n\nSelect a low-code platform that integrates with your current tools and scales with your needs.\n\nLook for platforms like OutSystems or Salesforce for enterprise-grade capabilities.\n\nEnsure it has visual development functionality and pre-built templates to accelerate development.\n\nTest the platform before committing to ensure it fits your specific requirements.\n\n4. Build and test your first workflow\n\nStart automating the repetitive parts first to see quick results.\n\nUse your process map to create workflows that trigger notifications, move data, or generate documents.\n\nTest with real users and iterate based on feedback.\n\nFocus on automating the tasks that take the most time or cause the most errors.\n\n5. Share results and expand\n\nCommunicate the impact of your automation to build momentum and gain support.\n\nMeasure time saved, errors reduced, and the process efficiency gained.\n\nShare these results within the company to encourage further automation efforts.\n\nIdentify the next process to automate based on the feedback and results.\n\n6. Hire a partner for deeper customisation\n\nEven low-code platforms require a learning curve. We can help customise workflows and integrate with existing system, and assist in ensuring security, scalability, and governance. We also guide you through more complex automation, so you can focus on growth.\n\nLow-code automation & AI\n\nAI can be easily integrated into workflows with low-code. For example, you could add a step to generate a client proposal with ChatGPT everytime you add a lead to your CRM. That proposal could then be sent for human editing and approval, before being sent to the customer.\n\nUnscoured, unique processes may require AI to be automated. In general, low-code automation excels at repetitive tasks, while AI automation handles unstructured data and steps remarkably well – even if humans are required in the loop. So choosing AI or low-code depends on the process you’re trying to automate.\n\nAnd the best part? to the drag-and-drop features and pre-built AI models, teams can implement AI-powered automation without relying on complex coding or IT departments.\n\nLow-code automation vs. RPA vs automation: what’s the difference\n\nIt’s easy to get caught up in the different buzzwords, but low-code automation, RPA (Robotic Process Automation), and traditional automation each serve different purposes.\n\nLow-code automation\n\nis all about building and adapting workflows quickly, using visual tools and minimal coding, perfect for teams that want flexibility without needing deep technical skills.\n\nRPA\n\n, on the other hand, focuses on automating repetitive, rule-based tasks using bots — great for handling structured, high-volume processes like data entry or invoice processing.\n\nTraditional\n\nautomation\n\nis typically more rigid, relying on coding to set up processes and often needing more time and resources to build.\n\nLow-code automation pitfalls\n\nWhile low-code automation is a powerful tool, it’s not without its challenges. Low-code platforms are fantastic for simple, step-by-step processes, but when it comes to highly customised workflows or complex integrations, you might hit a wall. That’s where the expertise of a partner, like Near Partner, can make all the difference, ensuring everything runs smoothly and is tailored to your needs.\n\nAnother risk is the temptation to automate too quickly without understanding the full scope of the process. Rushing can lead to errors, missed steps, or poorly designed workflows that create more issues than they solve.\n\nLastly, as with any new technology, a lack of proper governance and oversight can create chaos, especially when different teams start automating without standardised processes in place. It’s essential to approach low-code automation with a clear strategy and the right expertise to avoid these pitfalls.\n\nNear Partner, your low-code automation partner\n\nStill unsure how low-code automation can transform your operations? You’ve come to the right place. At\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we’ve fully embraced low-code development, and we understand that change can feel daunting — especially in traditionally conservative industries.

    "content": "Agentic AI goes beyond assistants, acting autonomously to achieve business goals. Learn what it is, where it works, and how to use it effectively.\n\nDespite the rapid adoption of AI across organisations, many teams still struggle to see real, sustained impact. Tools are deployed, pilots are launched, and dashboards light up, yet everyday work often looks much the same.\n\nThe issue is rarely the technology itself. More often, it’s about\n\nhow\n\nAI is designed and embedded into operations. This is where agentic AI comes in. Instead of simply responding to prompts or supporting isolated tasks, agentic AI systems are designed to pursue goals, make decisions, and act autonomously within defined boundaries.\n\nIn this article, we’ll explore what agentic AI really is, how it differs from\n\nAI assistants\n\n, where it delivers value, and what it takes to implement it responsibly.\n\nWhat is agentic AI?\n\nAgentic AI refers to AI systems that operate as\n\nautonomous agents\n\nrather than reactive tools. Instead of waiting for a user command, an agentic AI is given a\n\ngoal\n\n(for example, improving customer response times or keeping a sales pipeline healthy) and then decides how to achieve it.\n\nTo do that, an agentic system typically starts by understanding the objective it is responsible for. Then it breaks that objective into smaller tasks, decides what action to take next and executes those actions across systems or tools. Finally, it evaluates the results and adjusts its approach.\n\nIn simple terms, agentic AI doesn’t just help you do the work. It helps\n\nrun\n\nthe work.\n\nAgentic AI vs AI assistants: what’s the difference?\n\nAI assistants\n\nsupport users. They respond to prompts, summarise information, draft content, analyse data, or suggest next steps, but they rely on human input to move forward – it’s what happens when you enter a prompt into ChatGPT.\n\nAgentic AI systems\n\n, on the other hand, operate with a degree of autonomy. Once a goal and guardrails are defined, they decide what to do next, act, check outcomes, and continue until the objective is met or human intervention is required. They orchestrate AI assistants to get the job done.\n\nA simple way to think about it: AI assistants are\n\nreactive;\n\nagentic AI is\n\ngoal-driven.\n\nBoth have their place. The key is knowing when autonomy adds value and when it introduces unnecessary risk.\n\nWhy agentic AI can transform your workflow\n\nWhen designed well, agentic AI can have a significant impact on how your organisation operates.\n\n1. Reduced operational friction\n\nAgentic systems can manage multi-step processes end to end: monitoring inputs, triggering actions, coordinating systems, and following up automatically. This reduces handoffs, delays, and manual oversight.\n\n2. Increased autonomy\n\nInstead of relying on people to constantly monitor dashboards or queues, agentic AI can watch for signals, detect anomalies, and act immediately. Decisions happen faster and consistently, even as volume grows.\n\n3. It keeps humans focused on high-value work\n\nBy taking ownership of repetitive coordination and execution, agentic AI frees teams to focus on judgement, creativity, and complex problem-solving, areas where humans still outperform machines.\n\nWhere agentic AI works best\n\nAgentic AI is most effective in environments where goals are clear, rules can be defined, and actions can be executed digitally.\n\nCommon examples include:\n\nCustomer operations\n\n: routing cases, prioritising responses, triggering follow-ups, and escalating when needed;\n\nSales and revenue operations\n\n: monitoring pipelines, updating\n\nCRMs\n\n, prompting next-best actions, and flagging risk;\n\nIT and internal operations\n\n: handling service requests, monitoring systems, and coordinating remediation steps;\n\nProcess automation\n\n: managing workflows that span multiple tools, teams, or data sources.\n\nThe limitations and risks of agentic AI\n\nAgentic AI brings autonomy into everyday operations, which inevitably changes how organisations think about risk. While the potential upside is significant, these systems need to be designed and governed carefully to avoid unintended consequences.\n\nLoss of control without clear guardrails\n\nAgentic systems act independently once goals are set. If boundaries are poorly defined, an agent may take actions that go beyond what teams are comfortable with, especially when interacting with sensitive systems or triggering irreversible processes. Clear permissions, approval flows, and escalation paths are essential to keep autonomy in check.\n\nUnexpected behaviour in edge cases\n\nEven well-designed agents can struggle with situations that fall outside the norm. Ambiguous requests, incomplete information, or rare scenarios may lead to decisions that technically follow the rules but miss the intent. Without robust testing in real-world conditions, these edge cases tend to surface at the worst possible moment.\n\nData security and access risks\n\nAgentic AI often needs broad access to data and systems to be effective. That makes security a central concern. If access controls, audit logs, and governance policies are weak, organisations risk exposing sensitive customer, financial, or operational information through automated actions that are hard to trace.\n\nTrust and accountability challenges\n\nFor teams to rely on agentic AI, they need to understand how and why decisions are made. If actions cannot be explained or reviewed after the fact, trust erodes quickly. Transparency and accountability are not just technical features, they are critical to long-term adoption.\n\nTaken together, these challenges highlight an important principle: agentic AI should never be treated as a black box. Human oversight, continuous monitoring, and thoughtful design ensure that autonomy enhances performance instead of introducing new sources of risk.\n\nHow to approach agentic AI responsibly\n\nTo make agentic AI deliver real value, organisations should start with discipline, not ambition.\n\n1. Start from a concrete business outcome\n\nAvoid vague goals like “automate operations.” Instead, define measurable outcomes: reduced cycle time, improved resolution rates, fewer manual interventions.\n\n2. Define clear boundaries\n\nSpecify what the agent can and cannot do, which systems it can access, and when human approval is required.\n\n3. Build transparency in\n\nYou should be able to understand\n\nwhy\n\nthe agent took a certain action and intervene when necessary.\n\n4. Test in real-world conditions\n\nMessy data, incomplete information, and edge cases are the norm, not the exception. Test agents in realistic scenarios before scaling.\n\n5. Treat agents like team members\n\nSet KPIs, monitor performance, review outcomes, and continuously improve how the agent operates.\n\nMaking agentic AI work with Near Partner\n\nMost organisations don’t struggle with AI because they lack tools. They struggle because autonomy, integration, and governance are hard to get right.\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we help companies design and implement agentic AI systems that are aligned with real workflows, integrated into existing platforms, and built with control and accountability in mind.\n\nIf you’re exploring how agentic AI could work in your organisation,\n\nlet’s talk\n\n.

    "content": "Build a robust AI learning strategy for your organisation. Learn how to implement AI learning programmes, avoid common HR pitfalls, and empower your team to thrive.\n\nThe conversation around artificial intelligence has shifted. For business leaders and HR managers, the challenge is no longer just about which software to buy, but how to ensure their people are capable of using it. To remain competitive, modern organisations must move beyond seeing AI as a task for the IT department and start treating AI learning as a core competency for every employee.\n\nIn this article, we break down what AI learning means for your workforce, how to structure an effective training programme, why it is critical for modern organisations to stay aligned with reality, and what it takes to implement these systems in a way that delivers lasting value.\n\nWhy AI learning literacy is essential\n\nAI learning is less about coding and more about building a deep, functional literacy within your team. It represents the vital shift from a static organisation to one that adaptively improves over time.\n\nFostering this environment means empowering staff to look past the “black box” of technology and develop a sharp, contextual understanding of what\n\nAI can and cannot achieve\n\n. This literacy ensures that teams don’t just follow automated outputs blindly but instead use their fluency to refine predictions and actions, maintaining a crucial “human-in-the-loop” oversight.\n\nUltimately, when a team masters the ethics of data quality and the nuances of the learning process, they transition from being mere users of technology to strategic architects of a continuously improving business.\n\nWhat to include in your AI learning programme\n\nA successful internal training programme doesn’t need to turn your staff into programmers. Instead, your AI learning curriculum should focus on these four pillars:\n\nDemystifying the technology\n\nExplaining how algorithms learn patterns from data rather than just following hard-coded rules.\n\nPrompt engineering and feedback loops\n\nTeaching staff that AI learning depends on feedback; users must know how to signal success or failure to improve outcomes.\n\nGovernance in AI learning\n\nEstablishing clear ownership and\n\ncompliance standards\n\nto manage the complexity of these systems.\n\nIdentifying use-cases\n\nHelping employees spot where a learning system can improve accuracy over time compared to traditional, rigid automation.\n\nCommon pitfalls in organisational AI learning\n\nWhen implementing an AI learning strategy, it is easy to fall into the trap of\n\ntreating technology as a simple “plug-and-play”\n\nfeature rather than a deep organisational capability. This often leads to training that is too technical and lacks the necessary collaboration between HR, leadership, and IT.\n\nAnother frequent mistake is\n\nignoring the data foundations\n\n; even the most enthusiastic team cannot succeed if their learning is built on biased or outdated information.\n\nPerhaps most critically, many organisations fail by\n\nfostering fear instead of curiosity\n\n. If employees feel that AI is a threat to their job security rather than a tool to augment their expertise, they will hesitate to provide the essential feedback that allows these systems to improve, ultimately stalling the organisation’s progress.\n\nBest practices for delivering AI learning to your team\n\nSuccessful upskilling requires more than just access to tools – it demands a structured approach that prioritises practical results and long-term capability over simple experimentation.\n\n1.    Tailor training through role-specific workshops\n\nGeneric training often fails because it lacks immediate relevance. AI learning should be directly mapped to how your business functions day-to-day. For example, while marketing teams focus on trend discovery, operations should focus on process optimisation. By aligning training with specific workflows, employees quickly identify how AI helps them resolve cases or prioritise tasks.\n\n2.    Prioritise hands-on application over theory\n\nThe most effective way to understand AI is through real-world interaction. Move away from theoretical lectures and encourage teams to work with actual business data. This allows them to see firsthand how a model builds its “understanding” of patterns. Practical interaction also highlights the critical importance of data freshness, as staff witness how poor inputs immediately lead to poor outputs.\n\n3.    Implement active feedback loops\n\nTeaching staff how to interact with AI is a core pillar of learning. Users must be trained to signal success or failure to the system to improve future outcomes. These feedback loops are what prevent AI from remaining a “static” tool, ensuring that both the software and the people stay aligned with a constantly changing business reality.\n\n4.    Incentivise curiosity to overcome resistance\n\nA major pitfall in AI adoption is fostering fear instead of curiosity. If employees view AI as a threat to job security, they will hesitate to provide the feedback necessary for the system to improve. Leaders must frame\n\nAI as a tool\n\nto augment expertise rather than replace it, encouraging a culture where experimentation is rewarded.\n\n5.    Establish clear governance and ownership\n\nFor AI learning to deliver lasting value, there must be clear\n\ncompliance standards\n\nand ownership. This involves a collaborative effort between HR, IT, and leadership to manage the complexity of these systems. Establishing these guardrails early ensures that the team’s learning is built on a foundation of data quality and ethical standards.\n\n6.    Audit and refresh data foundations\n\nEven the most enthusiastic team cannot succeed if their learning is built on biased or outdated information. A critical step in any learning programme is teaching the team to master the ethics of data quality. Regular audits of the data being used for training ensure that the AI’s “understanding” remains accurate and aligned with reality.\n\n7.    Promote a “Human-in-the-Loop” mindset\n\nTraining must ensure that teams do not follow automated outputs blindly. A key practice is developing the fluency to refine predictions and maintain human oversight. By treating AI as a partner that requires constant validation, the organisation maintains control and ensures that AI outputs are used to make strategic, well-informed decisions.\n\n8.    Identify and document high-impact use cases\n\nHelping employees spot exactly where a learning system can improve accuracy over time is essential. Instead of traditional, rigid automation, teams should be encouraged to identify tasks where AI can learn from business patterns to deliver better results. Documenting these “wins” helps to scale the learning across other departments.\n\n9.    Commit to an ongoing learning process\n\nAI is not a “plug-and-play” feature or software you deploy once and forget. To prevent skills from becoming obsolete, organisations must treat AI literacy as a core, ongoing competency. This requires regular intervals of retraining and refinement to ensure the business remains a “strategic architect” of its own improvement.\n\nBuilding AI Skills from Within: Our Salesforce AI Learning Initiative\n\nTo truly embrace the AI-powered future, we launched an internal initiative focused on strengthening our Salesforce team’s skills in Artificial Intelligence, from both an admin and developer perspective. The goal is to ensure that every team member masters the fundamentals of AI and can apply them practically in their day-to-day work. For our developers, this learning path is mandatory and supported by a buddy system that encourages collaboration, accountability, and shared growth, along with weekly check-ins to exchange progress, insights, and questions.\n\nAfter three months of structured learning, teams will put theory into practice through a one-month hands-on challenge, culminating in project presentations in March 2026 and a prize for standout contributions. This initiative reflects our belief that adopting AI starts from within — by continuously learning, experimenting, and preparing our people to lead in the AI-driven digital era.\n\nMaster AI learning with Near Partner\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we help companies design and implement AI learning systems that fit real workflows and deliver measurable impact. From data strategy to governance and continuous improvement, we focus on making AI practical, reliable, and valuable for your organisation.\n\nIf you’re ready to move from experimental tools to systems and teams that actually learn and improve over time,\n\ntalk to us\n\n.

    "content": "Product Lifecycle Management Software can save you countless hours in team huddles. Here’s how to choose or build one that works for you.\n\nYou’ve built a product. But what happens after it launches? Too often, the lifecycle of a product is treated as an afterthought: split across spreadsheets, scattered feedback, and isolated teams. Meanwhile, opportunities slip through, quality suffers – and you waste countless hours trying to catch up.\n\nProduct Lifecycle Management software helps companies bring order to the chaos, by connecting people, processes, and data, so products don’t just get made, they get better.\n\nLet’s break down how it works, why it matters, and how to choose a PLM system that actually supports the way your business works.\n\nWhat Is Product Lifecycle Management?\n\nProduct Lifecycle Management (PLM) is how companies keep a clear view and control over a product’s entire journey – from the moment someone sketches the first idea, through designing, testing, building and launching. After that, PLM helps track ongoing updates, support, and eventually, the day the product is retired or replaced.\n\nIt connects people from different teams (designers, engineers, marketers, and manufacturers) so they can easily share information and make smarter decisions. Instead of working in separate silos or passing the product like a baton in a relay race, everyone collaborates in one place with up-to-date info.\n\n6 stages of Product Lifecycle Management\n\nFrom ideation to end-of-like, these are the 6 main steps a Product Lifecycle Management workflow will typically include.\n\n1. Ideation & concept development\n\nHere’s where it all begins: the ideas, the sketches, the “what ifs”. A good Product Lifecycle Management setup helps you capture them, test them, and figure out which ones worth chasing.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nCollecting feedback, spot market gaps, or run wild with R&D.\n\nShaping real requirements.\n\nBuilding early concepts and sanity-check them.\n\nMaking sure someone’s going to want (and buy) this thing.\n\n2. Design & engineering\n\nNow things get serious. The product starts to take form (digitally, at least). Designers and engineers create the models, diagrams and BOMs that turn ideas into blueprints.\n\nWhat it includes\n\n:\n\nCreating clear, version-controlled designs.\n\nCollaborating across teams without endless email loops.\n\nDefining a single place to track every tweak, comment and update.\n\n3. Manufacturing & process planning\n\nOnce your designs are approved, it’s time to figure out how to build it properly. This is where Product Lifecycle Management proves its worth, connecting product specs to your factory floor (or suppliers halfway across the world).\n\nWhat it includes\n\n:\n\nChoosing the right suppliers and materials.\n\nPlanning production steps and resources.\n\nMaking sure it’s all compliant.\n\nEstimating costs before it’s too late.\n\n4. Product launch & go-to-market\n\nYou’re ready to launch. But can your team find the right product details, documentation, marketing assets, and compliance files without pinging five people on Slack? If yes: congrats, you probably have Product Lifecycle Management in place.\n\nWhat it include\n\n:\n\nGetting everything and everyone launch-ready.\n\nAvoiding delays because someone missed a step.\n\nCoordinating with sales, logistics, and support.\n\nKeeping everything aligned across regions.\n\n5. Support, maintenance & feedback\n\nOnce the product’s out there, real life begins.\n\nCustomers have questions\n\n. Bugs appear. Features are used in weird ways you didn’t expect. Product Lifecycle Management helps you stay on top of it, and feed that knowledge back into your process.\n\nWhat it includes:\n\nCreating Instant access to technical info and past updates.\n\nCustomer servicing and troubleshooting.\n\nTracking issues and what you’ve learned from them.\n\nTurning support calls into valuable insights.\n\n6. End-of-life management\n\nAll products reach their last season. PLM keeps your offboarding process clean, documented, and not chaotic.\n\nWhat it includes\n\nCommunicating end-of-life plans clearly.\n\nManaging stock and support.\n\nClosing compliance loops.\n\nMaking space (and plans) for the next version.\n\nProduct Lifecycle Management software benefits\n\nProduct Lifecycle Management might sound like something only massive manufacturers care about. But if you’re building anything (software, devices, systems, machinery, even services), PLM could be the thing standing between you and chaos. Here’s why it deserves your attention.\n\nIt brings all your teams onto the same page\n\nProduct teams, designers, compliance, procurement, sales – they all care about different things. Without PLM software, they’re probably working in silos, using different tools, talking past each other. PLM connects the dots, gives everyone a single source of truth, and finally makes cross-functional work… actually work.\n\nIt cuts down mistakes (the expensive kind)\n\nHow many products have hit production with the wrong specs? Or shipped with outdated documentation? Or had to be reworked at the last minute? PLM catches these gaps before they become headlines, by controlling versions, sign-offs, and traceability every step of the way.\n\nIt keeps compliance and quality in check\n\nProduct recalls, failed audits or lost certificates are not great for business. PLM helps manage the mountains of documentation, certifications, and audit trails that come with regulated products or complex supply chains. So, when someone asks “Where’s the proof this is safe?”, you’ve got it.\n\nIt captures knowledge (so it doesn’t walk out the door)\n\nPeople leave. Emails get deleted. Whiteboards get wiped. PLM keeps the valuable thinking, decisions, designs, and lessons learned in one place, so your team’s knowledge doesn’t vanish with every reorg or resignation.\n\nFeatures of Product Lifecycle Management Solutions\n\nHere’s what reliable PLM software really offers: the essential building blocks that make everything come together seamlessly.\n\nCentralised product data repository.\n\nA single hub for all product-related information: specs, CAD files, BOMs, test data, change requests, and approvals.\n\nVersion and change control.\n\nTracks every revision and design update, with full visibility into what changed, when, and by whom.\n\nWorkflow automation.\n\nCustomisable processes for design approvals, document sign-offs, and engineering change orders (ECOs).\n\nBill of Materials (BOM) management.\n\nStructured and multi-level BOM tracking, with real-time updates and linkage to design and production data.\n\nCollaboration tools.\n\nReal-time commenting, file sharing, and user tagging across teams (internal and external).\n\nDocument management.\n\nStructured storage and access control for technical files, certifications, and compliance documentation.\n\nAudit trails and traceability.\n\nComplete history of actions, decisions, and changes (critical for regulated industries).\n\nIntegration capabilities.\n\nBuilt-in or API-based connections to CAD tools, ERP systems, CRM platforms, and other core software.\n\nUser roles and permissions.\n\nGranular control over who can access, edit, approve, or view each part of the product lifecycle.\n\nAnalytics and reporting.\n\nDashboards and custom reports for tracking project status, timelines, resource usage, and compliance.\n\nOff-the-shelf vs custom-built PLM: what’s right for you?\n\nWhen choosing a Product Lifecycle Management software, you’ve got two main paths: buy a ready-made tool or build your own. Each has its strengths and its risks. The right choice depends on your business, your workflows, and how much control you really want.\n\nOff-the-shelf: faster start, less flexibility\n\nPre-built Product Lifecycle Management platforms can get you up and running quickly. They come with tried-and-tested features, support, and documentation. If your needs are fairly standard (or you’re looking to simplify things) this can be a solid option.\n\nPros:\n\nFaster deployment\n\nLower upfront cost\n\nProven functionality\n\nRegular updates and support\n\nCons:\n\nMay not match your workflows exactly\n\nCan be hard to integrate with legacy tools\n\nLimited customisation\n\nRisk of paying for features you don’t use\n\nCustom-built: tailored fit, longer runway\n\nBuilding your own PLM system means full control. You design it around your people, processes, and products. It takes more time and investment upfront, but if your business is complex or evolving fast, it can pay off big.\n\nPros:\n\n100% tailored to your way of working\n\nSeamless integration with your existing stack\n\nScales with your business, not someone else’s roadmap\n\nYou own the data, the logic, and the future\n\nCons:\n\nHigher initial investment\n\nLonger development time\n\nRequires the right tech partner (or internal team)\n\nOngoing maintenance is on you\n\nIn short: if you need a solid system fast and your processes are fairly standard, off-the-shelf might be enough. But if you’re juggling complexity, unique requirements, or big growth plans, custom-built could be the smarter long game.\n\nChoosing the right Product Lifecycle Management Software\n\nThe wrong choice can slow everything down and become a pricey regret. But the right one can change how your teams work together and how fast your products get to market. Here’s how to get it right from the start.\n\n1. Map your needs (not just the ideal ones)\n\nStart with the messy reality of how things\n\nactually\n\nwork in your company. What’s broken? Where are the bottlenecks? What data lives in someone’s inbox or personal Dropbox? Map your current product workflows, identify the pain points, and be brutally honest. Then ask: what\n\nshould\n\nbe smoother?\n\n2. Build a cross-functional task force\n\nPLM touches a lot of people. Designers. Engineers. Operations. Marketing. Legal. If you don’t involve them early, your “perfect” tool will miss half the real-world use cases. So, get a small, vocal group of stakeholders from each function. Make them part of the selection team. Let them be brutally honest too.\n\n3. Prioritise integration (PLM doesn’t live alone)\n\nWhatever tool you pick, it must\n\ntalk\n\nto the rest of your stack: CAD systems, ERP, CRM, project management tools, whatever you’re using. If it doesn’t\n\nplug in cleanly\n\n, your shiny new Product Lifecycle Management Software will just become another isolated silo with a login no one remembers.\n\n4. Look for configurability\n\nYou want something that adapts to your workflow, not a rigid system that demands you bend to it. But there’s a big difference between configurability (good) and heavy customisation (danger zone). Choose a platform that lets you tweak workflows, user permissions and dashboards easily, without needing to call a developer every time.\n\n5. Test it\n\nDon’t settle for a slick demo. Ask for a real trial and get your task force to use it with real tasks and real data. How long does it take to upload a drawing? To manage a change request? To pull a product version history?\n\n6. Check vendor support & roadmap\n\nWhen choosing a Product Lifecycle Management Software, you’re also choosing a partner. Ask how often the tool is updated. What’s on the roadmap? What support is offered beyond setup? A good PLM vendor will be in it for the long haul.\n\n7. Scale with confidence\n\nFinally, think ahead. Your needs will evolve. Your team will grow. Products will get more complex. Pick a tool that’s\n\nbuilt to scale\n\n, with permissions, storage, and architecture that won’t collapse under your next product line.\n\nCommon Product Lifecycle Management Software challenges (and how to overcome them)\n\nImplementing a Product Lifecycle Management Software is rarely a walk in the park. Resistance to change, juggling complex data and making sure everything actually talks to each other are just a few of the bumps along the way. But with the right approach, these challenges can become manageable (and even a bit enjoyable).\n\nIntegration with existing systems\n\nProduct Lifecycle Management Software works best when it connects flawlessly with your other tools, like ERP, CRM, or supply chain platforms. Off-the-shelf systems can struggle here, creating extra work. Map existing systems, plan integrations carefully, and make sure data flows as it should, so your team doesn’t waste time hunting for information across multiple platforms.\n\nData migration\n\nMoving years of legacy data into a new Product Lifecycle Management Software can feel like moving house – messy and stressful. We can handle this carefully, ensuring that every file, specification, and record arrives intact and ready to use. Our structured approach keeps your data clean and organised from day one.\n\nUser adoption and training\n\nTeams can resist change or get frustrated with new interfaces. That’s why we guide training in a way that makes sense for real workflows, provide ongoing support, and create user-friendly setups that feel intuitive instead of forced.\n\nCustomization needs\n\nFinding a Product Lifecycle Management Software that fits perfectly is tricky, to say the least. Too little customization, and it doesn’t match your processes; too much, and complexity skyrockets. The sweet spot is to tailor the system to match your unique workflows while keeping it lean, practical, and easy to manage.\n\nScalability issues\n\nMany solutions struggle when new products, teams, or data volumes increase. Your system should scale gracefully, handling expansion without slowdowns or disruptions.\n\nHow Near Partner can power your Product Lifecycle Management\n\nMaking Product Lifecycle Management effective means shaping tools and processes that fit your business like a glove, solving real-world problems without adding complexity.\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we build software that fits your way of working, helps your teams communicate better, and gets products out the door faster, without the usual pains.\n\nIf juggling your product processes feels like a circus act, we can help you drop some balls and focus on what matters.

    "content": "Discover what is a CRM SaaS, why it matters and how its helps businesses uncover new opportunities.\n\nWhen people hear “CRM,” many still think of endless spreadsheets, clunky interfaces, and a tool that sales teams reluctantly update at the end of the day. But CRM SaaS has evolved into something far more powerful. Today, it’s less about databases and more about driving growth, enabling teams to connect the dots between customer behavior, business strategy, and long-term revenue.\n\nThe market for CRM solutions is booming, but not all platforms are created equal. Choosing the right one can redefine how a company interacts with its customers. Discover what CRM SaaS means today and how you can make the most of it.\n\nWhat CRM SaaS really means today\n\nImagine knowing exactly which customers are ready to buy again, which leads need a nudge, or which campaigns are driving results. A cloud CRM brings everything together in one place, so marketing, sales, and service teams speak the same language and work toward shared goals.\n\nBecause it’s hosted online, CRM SaaS isn’t limited by geography, hardware, or heavy IT investment. It’s a central hub where all customer data, interactions, and processes live, accessible to any authorised team member with an internet connection. In practice, that means one single version of the truth about your clients, whether you’re in sales, marketing, or service.\n\nBy automating repetitive tasks and providing a clear view of priorities, teams can focus on what really drives growth, like building relationships, spotting opportunities, and\n\ndelivering experiences that keep customers coming back\n\n.\n\nWhat a good CRM SaaS should offer\n\nThe right platform can make a noticeable difference in daily operations, decision-making, and customer relationships. Here’s what to look for.\n\n1. Intuitive and user-friendly interface\n\nA good CRM should feel natural to use. Teams should be able to navigate, update, and extract insights without constant support. The easier it is to use, the more your staff will actually rely on it.\n\n2. Flexibility\n\nEvery company works differently. The CRM should adapt to your workflows, not force you into rigid processes. Customisable fields,\n\ndashboards\n\n, and automations allow the platform to fit your specific needs.\n\n3. Real-time data and reporting\n\nHaving accurate, up-to-date information is essential. Look for tools that provide clear dashboards, actionable reports, and alerts that help your team act quickly and confidently.\n\n4. Seamless integration with other tools\n\nYour CRM should play nicely with the apps and systems your teams already use, like email, marketing platforms, or finance tools.\n\nSmooth integration\n\nreduces friction and keeps information flowing naturally.\n\n5. Powerful automation\n\nAutomation can save time\n\n, but it should simplify rather than complicate. Tasks like reminders, follow-ups, and lead assignments should be smart, easy to adjust, and focused on meaningful actions.\n\n6. Scalability\n\nYour business will grow, and your CRM needs to grow with you. Check that it can handle increased users, more data, and advanced features over time without becoming slow or unwieldy.\n\n7. Reliable support and guidance\n\nEven the best software benefits from human insight. Access to responsive support, training, and practical advice ensures your teams stay confident and make the most of the platform. At\n\nNear Partner\n\nwe provide hands-on guidance, helping you configure, optimise, and adapt the CRM to real business needs.\n\nHow to implement CRM SaaS: a step-by-step guide\n\nImplementing a CRM SaaS solution can feel like a big leap, but it doesn’t have to be complicated. Here’s a step-by-step guide to make the process practical and rewarding.\n\n1. Define your goals and priorities\n\nBefore any software is chosen, get clear on what you want to achieve. Are you aiming to improve lead management, increase repeat sales, or better understand customer behavior? Mapping out priorities ensures the CRM is set up to deliver measurable outcomes, not just store data.\n\n2. Map your customer journey\n\nEven if you avoid the term “\n\ncustomer journey\n\n,” it’s useful to understand how clients interact with your business. Identify key touchpoints, decision moments, and common pain points. This helps configure the CRM so that it aligns with real-world workflows rather than forcing your team to adapt to the software.\n\n3. Select the right platform and features\n\nCRM SaaS comes in many shapes and sizes. Focus on a solution that fits your current needs while allowing room to grow. Integration capabilities, usability, and reporting options are often more important than fancy features. Remember: the right platform supports your business, not the other way around.\n\n4. Plan for data migration\n\nClean, structured data\n\nis the backbone of any CRM. Take time to audit existing records, remove duplicates, and standardise formats. A\n\nwell-planned migration\n\navoids frustration and ensures teams can trust the information they see.\n\n5. Engage your teams early\n\nSuccessful adoption depends on people, not just technology. Involve key users from the start, gather feedback, and show them how the platform will make their work easier. Training should be practical and relevant, demonstrating value in daily tasks rather than abstract features.\n\n6. Configure, test, and iterate\n\nStart with core processes and test them in real scenarios. Don’t try to do everything at once. Iterative configuration allows you to refine workflows, reports, and automations based on actual usage, creating a system that truly supports your teams.\n\n7. Monitor, measure, and improve\n\nOnce live, keep an eye on adoption rates, user satisfaction, and business outcomes. CRM SaaS evolves with your company. Regularly review performance, tweak processes, and expand capabilities as your needs grow.\n\n8. Partner for long-term success\n\nA CRM only works if it fits the way your team actually operates.\n\nNear Partner\n\nbrings both technical expertise and a practical understanding of business needs. We help\n\ncustomise Salesforce\n\nto your workflows, make sure integrations run like they should, and provide guidance along the way. The aim is to make your CRM genuinely useful in day-to-day work, while staying flexible as your business grows.\n\nHow to get the most from your CRM SaaS\n\nA CRM platform can do a lot, but its impact depends on how you use it beyond the initial setup.\n\n1. Treat CRM as a living system\n\nData, processes, and customer behaviors change constantly. Review your workflows, dashboards, and automations regularly to keep them relevant. Small tweaks over time prevent the system from becoming outdated or misaligned with your business reality.\n\n2. Focus on insights\n\nIt’s easy to track clicks, calls, or meetings. The real value comes from spotting patterns and trends. Encourage your team to use CRM reports to make decisions, anticipate client needs, and discover opportunities before they become obvious.\n\n3. Personalise interactions thoughtfully\n\nCRM allows you to segment and customise interactions at scale. Go beyond generic emails or outreach: use the data to offer clients something genuinely relevant, whether it’s advice, content, or timely support. This creates loyalty without overcomplicating your processes.\n\n4. Encourage collaboration across teams\n\nA CRM works best when everyone contributes and sees the bigger picture. Share insights between sales, marketing, and service teams. Encourage notes, comments, and updates that help colleagues understand client context, turning individual effort into collective intelligence.\n\n5. Keep it simple for adoption\n\nEven after launch, usability is key. Avoid adding unnecessary fields, rules, or automations that slow people down. The more intuitive and human the system feels, the more your team will rely on it rather than work around it.\n\n6. Learn from mistakes quickly\n\nNot every workflow or automation will work perfectly at first. Track what’s effective, what isn’t, and be ready to adjust without hesitation. Viewing the CRM as a tool for experimentation as well as management can uncover efficiencies you didn’t expect.\n\n7. Align metrics with business goals\n\nDon’t get lost in vanity metrics. Make sure the numbers you monitor reflect outcomes that matter: client retention, deal velocity, repeat purchases, or campaign effectiveness. This keeps the CRM tied to real business impact, rather than just activity tracking.\n\nMeasuring the success of your CRM SaaS\n\nHere’s how to check if your CRM SaaS is really helping your business achieve tangible outcomes.\n\nLead-to-deal conversion rate\n\n: out of all the leads you bring in, how many become paying customers? This tells you if your CRM is helping focus on quality, not just quantity.\n\nAverage deal cycle\n\n: how long does it take to close a deal from the moment a lead appears? The shorter the cycle, the faster your CRM is driving revenue.\n\nWin rate per sales stage\n\n: where do deals get stuck or lost? This metric highlights the exact points in your pipeline that need attention.\n\nRepeat purchase rate\n\n: are customers coming back for more? A higher percentage shows your CRM is building loyalty, not just one-time wins.\n\nCustomer response time\n\n: how quickly do you get back to inquiries? Faster replies often mean happier, more trusting clients.\n\nCustomer satisfaction (CSAT or NPS)\n\n: the ultimate reality check: do customers actually enjoy working with you?\n\nTime spent on admin tasks\n\n: is your team busy selling or stuck filling forms? Less admin time equals more time building relationships.\n\nManual follow-ups avoided\n\n: every automated reminder is one less thing falling through the cracks.\n\nError rate in customer records\n\n: clean, accurate data avoids costly mistakes and keeps interactions smooth.\n\nRevenue growth\n\n: the big one: is the CRM helping your business grow period over period?\n\nRetention rate\n\n: are you keeping the customers you worked so hard to win? A healthy CRM should make “goodbye” less common.\n\nCampaign effectiveness\n\n: are your marketing campaigns reaching the right people and converting them into leads? This metric shows if your CRM is amplifying your marketing efforts.\n\nTake your CRM SaaS to the next level with Near Partner\n\nImplementing a CRM SaaS is a significant step, but its real value comes from using it in a way that truly fits your business. When your data, processes, and insights come together, it stops being just software and starts being a real part of how you grow, connect with clients, and make decisions that matter.\n\nWorking with\n\nNear Partner\n\nmeans having a team that gets how your business really works.

    "content": "Agentforce, Einstein AI, and Data Cloud are all getting massive upgrades. These are the biggest news from Salesforce Winter ’25 release.\n\nGeolocation triggers that automatically notify customers when you arrive at your destination. Real-time support prompts that guide you through conversations with frustrated users. And the foresight to prevent those frustrations from happening in the first place.\n\nThese are just a few of the standout features in the\n\nSalesforce Winter ’25 Release\n\n— one of the most important milestones of the year for Salesforce and the companies that rely on it.\n\nHere are 10 unmissable updates — and what they could mean for your business.\n\n1.  Executive level decision making is now possible with AI agents\n\nIf previous Salesforce updates gave us smarter assistants,\n\nAgentforce\n\nfeels like a leap into executive-grade intelligence. Think of it less as a digital helper and more as a\n\nbusiness partner that anticipates, recommends, and executes within guardrails you define\n\n.\n\nInstead of waiting for instructions,\n\nAgentforce agents\n\ncan proactively surface opportunities, like alerting your sales team to a high-value lead about to churn or suggesting the next best action for a service case before it escalates. They’re not limited to Salesforce alone; they can be deployed across different channels, extending their reach into the real workflows where your teams and customers actually operate.\n\nFor leaders, this means less manual follow-up and firefighting, and more\n\npredictability, scale, and consistency\n\nin how teams engage with clients. It’s moving from reactive management to proactive strategy, which is something every executive has wished for in moments of operational overload.\n\n2.  AI just got more nuanced than ever (and niche friendly)\n\nWith Winter ’26,\n\nEinstein AI\n\nlevels up, connecting more deeply with Salesforce Data Cloud. Take\n\nEinstein Data Prism\n\n: beyond segmenting audiences, it also refines them with surgical precision. For a marketing leader, that could mean designing campaigns that actually resonate with micro-segments instead of broad categories. For a sales executive, it could mean surfacing which accounts are warming up and which need intervention (before numbers slip). That shift can redefine how leaders set priorities and allocate resources across the business.\n\n3.  This long awaited updated will make you forget about different data sources\n\nFor many leaders, data feels more like a burden than an advantage, scattered across systems, hard to reconcile, and often outdated by the time it reaches the boardroom.\n\nSalesforce’s\n\nData Cloud\n\nin Winter ’26 directly tackles this challenge, transforming fragmented information into a\n\nsingle, connected source of truth\n\n.\n\nWith\n\nData Cloud One\n\n, organizations running multiple Salesforce instances can finally consolidate them under one umbrella. That means finance, sales, marketing, and service aren’t working with conflicting numbers anymore. They’re looking at the same, real-time picture of the customer journey. Imagine the power of a quarterly planning meeting where every executive sees consistent, unified insights instead of debating over mismatched reports.\n\nThe platform doesn’t stop at internal systems. Enhanced near-real-time connectors (like those to Amazon Redshift) pull external data into the mix, enabling richer analytics and sharper predictions. Combined with Einstein’s intelligence, leaders can uncover which customer behaviors signal loyalty, which indicate churn, and where to focus investment for the biggest impact.\n\n4.  Managing complex accounts is now much more simple\n\nManaging complex accounts often feels like steering a ship through fog. Multiple stakeholders, hidden risks, and shifting priorities make it easy for opportunities to slip away. Winter ’26 unleashed a new version\n\nSales Cloud\n\nwith an array of features to cut through this complexity.\n\nAccount Plans\n\n: it is a living strategy document inside Salesforce. It pulls together SWOT analyses, competitive landscapes, and relationship maps, helping teams align on priorities for high-value clients. For executives overseeing multi-million-dollar accounts, this means greater control and visibility over long sales cycles.\n\nProspecting Center\n\n: uses Data Cloud’s intelligence to surface accounts most likely to engage. Instead of spreading sales efforts thin, leaders can direct teams toward opportunities with the highest return.\n\nConversation Insights\n\n: now has\n\nSales Signals\n\n, which detect emerging customer concerns or trending topics from calls and meetings.\n\nSales Cloud becomes less about record-keeping and more about\n\nforward-looking strategy\n\n. In practice, this helps sales leaders answer the toughest questions with confidence:\n\nWhich accounts are truly worth pursuing right now? How should we allocate our best people? Where is the market moving next?\n\n5.  Winter ’26 release is a step closer to effortless automation\n\nWith Winter ’26,\n\nFlow Builder\n\nevolves into a true automation engine. The new\n\nevent-triggered flows\n\nmean that the system can automatically respond to actions (a customer signing a contract, a lead downloading a whitepaper, or a technician completing a field visit) without anyone needing to click a button.\n\nEven more interesting is the arrival of\n\nPath Experiments\n\n. Think of it as A/B testing for customer journeys inside Salesforce. Leaders can now test different approaches (say, whether a personalized email or a phone call drives faster deal progression) and roll out the winning strategy to the whole team. With Einstein capable of generating formulas on request, even non-technical managers can customize processes without waiting for developer support.\n\n6.  New features for customer support – including for real-time interactions\n\nWith Winter ’26,\n\nService Cloud\n\nintroduces intelligence that helps leaders strike the right balance between quality and efficiency.\n\nThe new\n\nService Intelligence\n\ndashboard brings clarity to case management, flagging potential escalations before they spiral.\n\nCase Summaries\n\n, powered by Einstein, give agents concise overviews so they can prioritize and resolve faster. For leaders, this means shorter response times and a clearer understanding of service bottlenecks.\n\nEinstein Article Recommendations\n\ndelivers context-specific answers directly to agents during customer conversations. Instead of reinventing the wheel for every support ticket, agents are armed with the best solutions instantly, reducing costs while improving satisfaction scores.\n\n7.  Field Service apps just got a major boost\n\nFor organizations that rely on mobile or remote teams, operational complexity often happens far from HQ. Winter ’26 gives\n\nField Service\n\nthe intelligence to keep field operations smooth and reliable.\n\nWith\n\ngeolocation-triggered flows\n\n, the system can automatically log a technician’s arrival at a site, send the customer a notification, or initiate a follow-up process. And all without human input. This reduces administrative friction and ensures accuracy in reporting.\n\nThe new\n\nhierarchical asset view\n\nadds another layer of efficiency. Technicians can now see parent-child relationships between assets directly on their mobile device, making troubleshooting faster and reducing repeat visits. For leaders, this translates into higher first-time fix rates, happier customers, and lower operational costs.\n\n8.  Better, faster websites and collaboration\n\nAs customer and partner ecosystems expand, leaders need platforms that foster collaboration without slowing things down. Winter ’26 strengthens\n\nExperience Cloud\n\nto deliver exactly that.\n\nWith\n\nEnhanced Sites\n\n, companies can upgrade existing environments to gain flexible content management, SEO-optimized URLs, and partial deployments. That means faster rollouts, better discoverability, and more control over how brand presence evolves online.\n\nMeanwhile,\n\nPartner Connect\n\ntakes partnership collaboration to a new level. By allowing partners to see shared records and real-time updates, it removes friction in joint deals and projects. For executives, this means fewer missed opportunities, stronger alliances, and greater transparency in critical business relationships.\n\n9.  Simpler content creation and catalogue management\n\nGrowth means doing more, but smarter. Winter ’26 expands\n\nMarketing Cloud\n\nand\n\nRevenue Cloud\n\nto give leaders tools that scale without diluting quality.\n\nIn\n\nMarketing Cloud\n\n, Einstein now supports\n\nmultilingual content creation and automated translations\n\n, helping global brands stay consistent across regions without draining resources. Event-based campaign templates make it easier to launch campaigns triggered by customer actions, ensuring relevance and timeliness.\n\nRevenue Cloud\n\ncontinues its evolution into a central hub for sales and revenue processes. With enhancements to CPQ and product catalogue management, it streamlines the way companies configure, price, and sell. For executives, this means faster deal cycles and more predictable revenue streams.\n\n10.  Better handling of sensitive data\n\nFinally, in an era where trust is as valuable as innovation, Winter ’26 puts\n\nsecurity at the forefront\n\n. The\n\nPrivacy Center\n\nnow offers stronger data retention and masking policies, ensuring\n\ncompliance\n\nwith global standards like GDPR. Leaders can rest easier knowing that sensitive data is being managed responsibly.\n\nAdditionally, Salesforce has connected\n\nEvent Monitoring\n\nto Data Cloud, allowing real-time analysis of system performance and user behavior. For IT and compliance leaders, this provides a proactive layer of oversight that spots irregularities early and strengthens governance without slowing down the business.\n\nExplore the full potential of Salesforce with Near Partner\n\nWhat makes Salesforce Winter ’26 remarkable is not just the technology itself, but the way it opens new doors for organizations willing to rethink how they engage customers, manage data, and scale operations. Features like Agentforce or Data Cloud can sound futuristic, but in the hands of the right teams, they quickly translate into sharper decisions, faster execution, and measurable growth.\n\nHowever, the truth is that anyone can read the release notes. The real challenge is knowing what matters for\n\nyour\n\nbusiness and ignoring the rest. That’s the\n\nNear Partner\n\nmindset: practical ways to translate Salesforce updates into everyday wins that your teams and your clients will actually feel.\n\nWinter ’26 hands you a powerful toolbox, but what really matters is knowing which tool to grab, when to use it, and how to make it stick inside your business. That’s the journey worth taking. And it starts with choosing the right guide: Near Partner.\n\nGet in touch\n\n.",

    "content": "Find out what nearshore is, how it helps businesses and how to implement in your company.\n\nTight deadlines, stretched teams, and growing pressure to deliver more — faster. Sound familiar?\n\nIf you need to scale without losing control (or sleep),\n\nnearshoring\n\ncould be the strategy you’ve been overlooking.\n\nIn this guide, we break down what nearshore really means, how it works in practice, and how to get started — the smart way.\n\nWhat is nearshore?\n\nNearshoring means moving your software development or service operations to a nearby country – usually within the same or similar time zone – instead of offshoring to a far-flung destination.\n\nThe idea is simple: keep the benefits of outsourcing (access to talent, lower costs, scalability), but remove the friction that often comes with geographical and cultural distance.\n\nSimply put, it’s choosing partners who are easier to collaborate with, who understand your market context, and who can move fast without getting lost in translation.\n\nWhy nearshoring works: the key advantages\n\nFrom collaboration to cultural fit, these are the main benefits of nearshoring.\n\n1. Real-time collaboration\n\nWorking in overlapping time zones means you’re not stuck waiting overnight for answers. Teams can meet, debug, adjust and iterate — all within the same working day. That kind of fluidity cuts down project delays and reduces miscommunication.\n\n2. Cultural proximity that makes teamwork natural\n\nNearshore partners often share similar working hours, business culture, and expectations — which makes a huge difference when you need aligned decisions and fewer unnecessary back-and-forths.\n\n3. Lower operational risk\n\nWhen you’re working with nearshore partners, you’re often within similar legal, regulatory and data protection frameworks (think GDPR, for example). This means less compliance friction, clearer contracts, and more control over how your data and projects are handled.\n\n4. Top-tier talent\n\nNearshore regions are packed with qualified developers, designers, and engineers — many of whom have worked with international teams before. You get access to serious skills, fresh perspectives, and reliable delivery — without the premium costs of hiring in London, New York or Berlin.\n\nHow to choose a nearshore location\n\nChoosing a nearshore location is a strategic decision, because where your nearshore team is based will directly impact the quality of collaboration, the speed of delivery, and the overall experience. So, what should guide your decision?\n\n1. Cultural compatibility\n\nIt goes far beyond shared languages or time zones. You want to work with teams that understand your way of doing things: how you approach deadlines, feedback, autonomy, even meetings. When there’s alignment in how people work and think, everything moves faster and with fewer misunderstandings.\n\n2. Time zone overlap that actually works\n\nLook for at least 3 or 4 hours of shared working time. This allows for live standups, daily check-ins, or quick problem-solving without scheduling headaches. Too much overlap, however, might mean you’re just recreating an in-house team abroad, which defeats the point of flexible scaling.\n\n3. Access to qualified, experienced talent\n\nNearshore only works if the local talent pool is deep and mature. That means professionals with solid technical backgrounds, experience in cross-border teams, and the ability to work independently.\n\n4. Strong digital and business infrastructure\n\nHigh-speed connectivity, access to modern collaboration tools, and a tech-friendly environment are essential. A place with reliable digital infrastructure reduces operational friction and helps external teams feel more like an extension of your own.\n\n5. Legal, economic, and data security stability\n\nMake sure the location has clear legal frameworks for data protection, IP rights, and service contracts. You want to work with teams based in countries that offer predictability, especially for long-term projects.\n\n6. Supportive ecosystem\n\nSome locations – Portugal being a great example – have invested in creating environments that attract international tech business. That includes accelerator programs, developer communities, and government incentives that indirectly benefit you as a client.\n\nHow to choose a nearshore partner\n\nA nearshore partner becomes part of your\n\nextended team\n\n. So, the stakes are higher. You’re trusting them to deliver and also to think with you, keep the momentum going, and help you move faster without compromising quality.\n\n1. Track record with similar projects\n\nAsk what they’ve actually built. Look for\n\ncase studies\n\n, production-ready work, and long-term collaborations that show they can scale, adapt, and stay aligned through evolving priorities. Bonus points if they’ve worked with companies of your size and pace.\n\n2. Communication that feels like collaboration\n\nDo they really listen? Do they challenge when it makes sense? Are their answers thoughtful, clear, and free of buzzwords? From the first call, communication should feel easy, not effortful. You should never have to “decode” their emails or wait three days for an answer.\n\n3. Senior talent involved early on\n\nThe best partners bring experienced people to the table from day one. You’ll need help to shape realistic plans, get suggestions of better approaches, and get the delivery that actually match the promises.\n\n4. Process transparency\n\nYou don’t need a 100-page methodology. But you\n\ndo\n\nneed to know how they work, how they estimate, how they handle scope changes, how progress is tracked, and how risks are flagged early. Clarity here avoids nasty surprises later.\n\n5. Technical alignment and standards\n\nYour tech stack matters. But so do standards, security protocols, and dev practices. Your partner should be used to working with CI/CD pipelines, version control, automated testing, and should never need chasing for documentation or clean handovers.\n\n6. A mindset of ownership\n\nYou’ll spot this quickly: teams who ask the right questions, challenge vague specs, think beyond the ticket, and genuinely care if what’s being built will work for your users. That’s not extra, that’s what makes a real partner.\n\n5 signs nearshore is for you\n\nNot every company is ready to nearshore, but many wait longer than they should. If you’re seeing some of these signs, it’s probably time to start the conversation.\n\n1. Your internal team is stretched too thin\n\nProjects are piling up, delivery is lagging, and even small improvements get pushed down the priority list. You don’t need more hands; you need a smart extension of your team that can move with you.\n\n2. You want to scale, but not blindly\n\nHiring full-time can feel like a big leap, especially if you’re unsure of the long-term workload. Nearshoring gives you the flexibility to scale up fast, without locking into overhead.\n\n3. You’re looking for better collaboration, not just cheap execution\n\nOffshoring didn’t quite work. Time zones made sync impossible. Communication felt transactional. You want people who work close to your hours, think with you, and actually feel part of the process.\n\n4. You’ve got a clear roadmap and a growing backlog\n\nYou know what needs to be built. You even have specs. But capacity keeps getting in the way. Nearshoring can help you execute faster, without derailing your core team’s focus.\n\n5. You care about long-term value, not just short-term fixes\n\nYou’re not just\n\noutsourcing\n\na one-off feature. You’re investing in something that needs to evolve, scale, and integrate well over time. For that, you need continuity, and a partner who’s in it for more than a sprint.\n\n5 signs nearshore may not be for you\n\nNearshoring isn’t a fit for every team, and knowing that early can save time, budget, and frustration.\n\n1. Your product or tech direction isn’t clear yet\n\nIf you’re still figuring out what to build or how to build it, a nearshore team might not be the right move just yet. They can bring speed and expertise but not replace core product vision or leadership.\n\n2. Your internal processes are barely holding together\n\nIf collaboration tools, code management, or task tracking are chaotic (or non-existent), adding more people (even great ones) will only multiply the friction.\n\n3. You treat external teams as vendors, not partners\n\nNearshoring works best with shared ownership. If you’re only looking for a task executor rather than someone to contribute to your product’s evolution, this model might fall short.\n\n4. You’re not ready to invest in integration\n\nThis isn’t plug-and-play. Nearshoring requires intentional onboarding, open communication, and commitment from both sides. If you’re not willing (or able) to prioritise that, it won’t deliver what it could.\n\n5. You expect full results on day one\n\nThere’s always a ramp-up period. If you’re not open to some initial adaptation on processes, communication rhythms, or expectations, nearshoring may feel like it’s “not working,” when really it just needed space to click.\n\nHow to get started with nearshoring\n\nWith the right steps, you can build a nearshore setup that feels aligned, efficient and easy to manage. Here’s how to move forward.\n\n1. Define what you need\n\nStart by mapping out which parts of your operations could benefit from nearshoring. This could be software development, QA, design, customer support or even data management. Don’t aim to move everything at once. Be specific and realistic. Focus on roles or functions where quality, availability of talent, and time zone alignment can make a clear difference.\n\n2. Research the best-fit region\n\nPrice matters, but it’s not the only factor, or even the most important one. Look at regions where there’s a solid talent pool, good infrastructure, strong education systems, and cultural compatibility with your team.\n\n3. Choose a partner that aligns with your rhythm\n\nYou want a working relationship that flows. That means\n\nlooking for a partner\n\nwho understands your industry, has a proven track record, and can adjust to your processes and tools. Pay attention to how they communicate, how quickly they respond, and how they approach problem-solving.\n\n4. Start with a focused pilot\n\nBefore going all in, set up a small engagement: a short project, an MVP, or a few key roles. This gives you the chance to validate the collaboration, see how communication plays out, and refine your internal workflows. It’s a low-risk way to test the waters and get real insights into how the setup performs in practice.\n\n5. Build for long-term success\n\nOnce the foundation is working, prepare to scale. Standardise your onboarding, set up clear expectations around deliverables and communication, and invest in integrating the team into your\n\ncompany culture\n\n. Nearshoring works best when the external team feels like part of the internal one, instead of a separate unit.\n\nLooking for a nearshore partner that actually feels close?\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we’re close on the map – based in Portugal – but even closer in mindset, responsiveness, and the way we collaborate. We’re a boutique software house offering outsourcing and nearshore solutions, with a growing team of talented developers fluent in a wide range of technologies: from tried-and-tested languages like C++, Java, Python, and Ruby, to modern low-code platforms like Outsystems and Salesforce.\n\nLet’s build something solid together\n\n, with real connection, clear communication and momentum that doesn’t fade.",

    "content": "Has the time come to build your own custom software rather than relying on off-the-shelf solutions? Here’s how to make the call.\n\nChoosing to build custom software for your business was never going to be an easy decision.\n\nTake project management, for example. You probably started by browsing the usual suspects—Trello, Asana, Monday.com. Maybe you even tried patching the problem with a purpose-built Google Sheet. (At least it’s free, right?)\n\nIf you’re more technically inclined, you may have experimented with custom dashboards—or, if the budget allowed, explored premium ecosystems from Salesforce or Microsoft.\n\nYet for many business and IT leaders, this decision-making process ends up feeling overwhelming.\n\nSome tools are too rigid, others too open-ended. Some pack in far more features than any team will ever use (yet still pay for), while others are so bare-bones they require a stack of extra tools just to fill the gaps.\n\nSo… when is the right moment to build your own solution? What are the tell-tale signs that it’s worth investing the time and money, instead of adapting an off-the-shelf product?\n\nHere’s what you need to know to make the call.\n\nWhat custom software really means\n\nCustom software is exactly what it sounds like: software built specifically for your business, not adapted from someone else’s.\n\nUnlike off-the-shelf solutions,\n\ncustom software\n\nis designed around how your organisation. It doesn’t ask you to change processes to match the tool; it adapts to you, creating a layer of intelligence that unifies different platforms and workflows.\n\nFor companies trying to connect several systems, that flexibility is crucial. Each system speaks its own language, and custom software is what makes them understand each other, securely, efficiently, and in real time.\n\nThe benefits of custom software\n\nCustom software gives businesses something off-the-shelf tools rarely can: a perfect fit. Instead of forcing your team to adapt to rigid features or workarounds, custom solutions are designed around your exact workflows, goals, and constraints. The result is a system that feels intuitive from day one, reduces friction across teams, and scales naturally as the business grows—without piling on plugins, hacks, or extra subscriptions.\n\nIt also provides a strategic edge. With complete control over functionality, integrations, and data, businesses can innovate faster, automate more processes, and build digital experiences competitors simply can’t replicate. Custom software becomes an asset—not just a tool—supporting productivity, efficiency, and long-term differentiation in ways pre-packaged platforms are rarely able to match.\n\nOne of its biggest advantages is the ability to integrate deeply with your existing systems. Custom software can seamlessly connect PLM, ERP, CRM and even IoT devices, creating a unified operational backbone that off-the-shelf tools struggle to match. This level of integration turns software from a cost centre into a strategic asset that drives innovation across the organisation.\n\nLimitations of Custom Software\n\nDespite the advantages, custom software isn’t always the right solution. It typically requires a higher upfront investment—both in budget and time—compared to off-the-shelf tools. The development process involves discovery, design, testing, iterations, and ongoing maintenance, which means your team needs the bandwidth and commitment to stay involved. For businesses needing something immediate, predictable, or low-cost, this can be a significant hurdle.\n\nCustom solutions also introduce long-term responsibility. While ready-made tools handle updates, bug fixes, security patches, and new features automatically, custom software requires dedicated support—either internal or external. Without proper maintenance, even a great system can become outdated or vulnerable. It’s a powerful option, but one that works best when the organization is ready to invest not just in building the software, but in sustaining it.\n\nWhen to Build Custom Software\n\nDeciding whether to build custom software comes down to understanding your needs, your resources, and your long-term strategy. While it’s a powerful investment, it only pays off when certain conditions are in place. Here are the key factors to consider before making the call:\n\nYou have (or can maintain) the right technical support\n\nCustom software isn’t a one-and-done project—it requires ongoing maintenance, updates, and improvements. If you have an internal technical team, even a small one, you’re already in a strong position. And even if your team isn’t large enough to handle everything, combining internal oversight with an external development partner often gives you the best of both worlds: expertise, flexibility, and long-term stability.\n\nYour business has needs that off-the-shelf tools can’t meet\n\nIf your workflows are unique, your processes highly specific, or your integration needs more complex than what standard tools offer, custom software becomes a strategic advantage. It lets you build exactly what your team needs—no workarounds, no compromises, no unnecessary features. The more tailored your operations, the more custom software pays for itself.\n\nYou can turn the software into an asset for customers\n\nCustom software becomes even more valuable when it’s not just for internal use, but something your customers can interact with directly. Whether it’s a client portal, scheduling system, dashboard, or even a white-label product, software that enhances the customer experience becomes a long-term competitive asset and can even open new revenue streams.\n\nYou have the budget for development and ongoing maintenance\n\nBuilding custom software requires a higher upfront investment than subscribing to an off-the-shelf tool. Beyond development, you need to factor in ongoing hosting, improvements, and fixes. If your budget allows for both the build and the upkeep, custom software can deliver a strong return. If not, a hybrid solution or customization on top of an existing platform may be a better first step.\n\nOff-the-shelf tools are becoming too expensive or limiting\n\nSometimes the cost of multiple licenses, add-ons, integrations, and overlapping tools ends up exceeding the price of building your own system. Or, the limitations of commercial tools—rigid workflows, missing features, expensive upgrades—start slowing you down. When the cumulative cost (financial or operational) keeps rising, custom software often becomes the more efficient option.\n\nYou have the time to build properly\n\nCustom software takes time. Discovery, design, development, testing, and iteration all require patience and alignment across your team. If you need something operational tomorrow, off-the-shelf tools may be the only realistic option. But if you’re planning ahead and can allocate the months needed to design something meaningful, custom software sets you up for a more scalable, sustainable solution.\n\nYour team is relying on too many manual workarounds\n\nIf employees are spending hours copying data between tools, exporting spreadsheets, updating trackers, or improvising processes that software should handle, it’s a strong signal that existing tools are failing. Custom software can automate repetitive tasks and eliminate friction that hurts productivity.\n\nYour current tool stack is becoming too fragmented\n\nWhen you need five—or fifteen—different apps to handle what should be a single workflow, complexity explodes. If integrations are brittle, data gets duplicated, and onboarding becomes painful, a consolidated custom system can fix the root problem rather than treat symptoms.\n\nData lives in too many places (and you can’t trust it)\n\nIf your data is scattered across platforms and never fully accurate or up to date, custom software can centralize it. Reliable, real-time data is often reason enough to build a tailored solution—especially when reporting matters to leadership or customers.\n\nSecurity, compliance, or privacy requirements are too specific\n\nRegulated industries (healthcare, finance, HR, legal, etc.) often discover that generic tools don’t meet their obligations. If you need strict access controls, audit logs, encryption, or industry-specific compliance, custom software lets you design these protections exactly as required.\n\nyour business model is evolving faster than your tools\n\nWhen your company is innovating—adding services, new operational models, or more complex customer flows—off-the-shelf tools rarely keep up. If your software is slowing innovation rather than enabling it, that’s a tell-tale sign it’s time to build something that grows with you.\n\nYou need a competitive differentiator\n\nIf software is central to how you deliver value—operations, customer service, product experience—it shouldn’t be generic. Custom software lets you build capabilities competitors can’t buy or replicate. If differentiation matters, custom is often the only real option.\n\nThe ROI of Custom Software\n\nCalculating the ROI of custom software starts with understanding two sides of the equation:\n\nwhat it costs to build and maintain\n\n, and\n\nwhat it saves or earns for the business over time\n\n. On the cost side, you’ll want to factor in the full development lifecycle—discovery, design, engineering, testing, deployment—as well as ongoing hosting and maintenance. You should also include the opportunity cost of your internal team’s time, plus any external partners supporting the project. Add all of this together, and you have your\n\nTotal Cost of Ownership\n\n(TCO).\n\nOn the revenue side, ROI comes from two sources:\n\nsavings\n\n(what the software eliminates or reduces) and\n\ngains\n\n(what the software enables). Savings can include fewer subscription fees, reduced manual work, faster workflows, fewer errors, lower customer support workload, or decreased operational costs. Gains come from improved conversion rates, higher customer satisfaction, new features that drive upsell, faster service delivery, or entirely new revenue streams if the software becomes customer-facing. Once you quantify these improvements—monthly or yearly—you can calculate ROI using a simple formula:\n\nROI = (Financial Gains – Total Cost of Ownership) / Total Cost of Ownership\n\nThe more accurately you track time saved, tools replaced, revenue generated, and efficiencies gained, the clearer the business case becomes.\n\nHow long does it take to build custom software?\n\nThe timeline for building custom software depends largely on the complexity of the solution, the number of features, and how many systems it needs to integrate with. Simple tools—like internal dashboards, automations, or lightweight workflow apps—can often be built in\n\n4 to 12 weeks\n\n. Mid-sized platforms with multiple user roles, advanced features, or integrations with systems like ERP, PLM, or CRM typically require\n\n3 to 6 months\n\n. Large-scale platforms, customer-facing portals, or IoT-connected systems can take\n\n6 to 12+ months\n\n, often delivered in phases so teams can start using key functionality earlier.\n\nWhat matters most is that development isn’t a single block of work—it’s a sequence. The process usually includes discovery and scoping, UX/UI design, development, testing, deployment, and ongoing iterations based on user feedback. Well-managed projects follow agile delivery, meaning new features are released continuously rather than waiting for a “big launch.” This approach allows businesses to see value sooner while reducing risk and ensuring the final product genuinely matches how teams work.\n\nBuilding custom software with AI: what to expect\n\nAI-assisted development and vibe coding can dramatically accelerate how software gets built. One of the biggest advantages is speed: teams can turn ideas into prototypes in hours instead of weeks. AI helps generate interfaces, suggest workflows, write boilerplate code, and automate testing — reducing repetitive work and lowering initial development costs.\n\nVibe coding also makes early collaboration easier, since stakeholders can express what they want in natural language rather than technical specifications. It’s an excellent way to explore ideas, validate concepts faster, and keep development closely aligned with the product’s intended experience.\n\nBut vibe coding has limitations — and this is where expert support becomes essential. AI can generate impressive starting points, but it can’t replace careful architecture, security practices, compliance, or long-term maintainability.\n\nWithout experienced developers guiding the process, AI-generated code can quickly become inconsistent, inefficient, or fragile. Integrations with ERP, PLM, CRM or IoT systems still require deep technical judgement, and scaling a product safely requires the kind of engineering discipline AI can’t replicate. Vibe coding accelerates the journey, but human expertise ensures the software is robust, secure, and ready for real-world use.\n\nNear Partner: making custom software work for your whole business\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\nour approach blends strategy, engineering, and delivery:\n\nIntegration strategy\n\nto map how information and decisions should flow across your existing systems.\n\nCustom development\n\nto build connectors, APIs, and orchestration layers tailored to how your business operates.\n\nCloud and data expertise\n\nto ensure security, performance, and scalability.\n\nContinuous support and optimisation\n\nto evolve integrations as your business grows.\n\nSee your systems finally talking to each other, and watch your business run smoother than ever with custom software.\n\nStart the conversation with Near Partner today\n\n.",

    "content": "Risk sharing is redefining what partnership means: shared responsibility, shared results, shared growth. Learn what it is and how it works.\n\nEvery company talks about partnership. Fewer are willing to test what that word really means. In most collaborations, one side takes all financial risk while the other collects predictable fees, regardless of the outcome. Risk sharing challenges that imbalance. It ties success to measurable results and places both sides on equal footing. In this model, accountability becomes real. Discover what risk sharing really means, what to watch out for, and how to make it work in practice.\n\nWhat is the risk sharing model for development projects?\n\nRisk sharing is the grown-up version of collaboration. It happens where partners stop pretending every deal is risk-free and start admitting that uncertainty is part of doing real business.\n\nAt its core, risk sharing means exactly what it says: dividing risk between parties so everyone has skin in the game. When done right, it aligns incentives, builds trust, and turns “supplier-client” dynamics into something closer to co-ownership of outcomes. You win together, or you fix it together.\n\nLet’s say a manufacturing company was struggling with slow production cycles and recurring equipment failures, so they partner with a tech firm to implement a predictive maintenance system. Instead of a traditional supplier contract, they set up a risk-sharing model. Both sides agreed on clear performance metrics before the project started – say 15% reduction in unplanned downtime. To make it fair, the tech firm absorbed 30% of the implementation cost upfront. In return, they would receive a performance bonus if the targets were met, or a smaller fixed fee if not.\n\nThroughout the project, data from sensors and production reports was shared in real time, giving both teams full visibility of performance. At month four, let’s say that downtime had dropped 19%. The bonus was triggered automatically, and the partnership extended to new production lines.\n\nThis approach is gaining traction because businesses are tired of transactional partnerships that collapse the moment things get unpredictable. In a world where tech moves faster than contracts, sharing risk is how you stay agile without losing control.\n\nTraditional models vs. risk sharing: a different kind of partnership\n\nMost business relationships still follow a familiar script: one side provides a service or product, the other pays for it, and success is measured by delivery, instead of the real impact achieved. It’s neat, predictable, and in theory, “safe.” But it often creates a false sense of security.\n\nIn traditional models, risk sits unevenly on one side. The client shoulders the uncertainty of whether the solution will truly deliver, while the supplier focuses on fulfilling the contract as written. Everyone stays in their lane, but no one’s really driving toward the same destination.\n\nRisk sharing flips that dynamic. Instead of separating responsibilities, it fuses them. Both parties contribute to (and are affected by) the same outcomes. It’s a shift from\n\ntransactional\n\nto\n\nrelational\n\n, from\n\ndelivery\n\nto\n\nperformance\n\n, and from\n\nprotecting interests\n\nto\n\ngrowing them together\n\n.\n\nHere’s how they diverge in practice:\n\nAspect\n\nTraditional Model\n\nRisk-Sharing Model\n\nFocus\n\nDeliverables and deadlines\n\nOutcomes and value created\n\nRisk Distribution\n\nMostly on the client or end user\n\nShared proportionally between partners\n\nIncentives\n\nSupplier paid regardless of success\n\nRewards tied to measurable impact\n\nTransparency\n\nLimited to contract scope\n\nContinuous and open exchange of data\n\nFlexibility\n\nLow – predefined terms\n\nHigh – adaptable to evolving needs\n\nRelationship\n\nTransactional\n\nCollaborative and long-term\n\nSome may think that risk sharing replaces traditional models, but we like to think it elevates them. It takes the structure and discipline of conventional agreements and layers them with a sense of shared purpose. Instead of protecting each side from risk, it connects them through it\n\nBenefits of the risk sharing model\n\nWhen businesses start thinking in terms of shared outcomes instead of isolated responsibilities, something powerful happens. Here’s why the smartest partnerships are built around it.\n\n1. Real commitment\n\nWhen both sides have something at stake, effort stops being performative. Everyone’s pulling in the same direction, not because they are supposed to, but because success is genuinely mutual. That kind of alignment turns abstract KPIs into shared goals.\n\n2. More transparency\n\nRisk sharing pushes both sides to open up about costs, dependencies, and performance metrics early on. It creates a culture of honesty that prevents the usual finger-pointing when challenges appear.\n\n3. Flexibility to adapt\n\nTraditional contracts lock partners into rigid terms that age quickly. Risk-sharing models, on the other hand, are designed to evolve. They make room for real-time adjustments.\n\n4. Shared innovation\n\nWhen risk is shared, teams are more willing (or pushed) to test, iterate, and explore new approaches. That’s often where the best breakthroughs emerge, in the space where both sides are invested in finding a better way.\n\n5. Stronger long-term relationships\n\nPartnerships built on shared risk tend to last longer because they’re based on understanding. When both parties have weathered challenges together, the bond becomes less transactional and more strategic. And that’s where real collaboration lives.\n\nHow risk sharing works in practice\n\nIt’s one thing to agree that sharing risk makes sense, but it’s another to bake it into a partnership. The essence of a good risk-sharing model lies in design: clear rules, measurable outcomes, and mutual trust that’s proven.\n\n1. Define what “success” looks like\n\nBefore any contract is signed, both sides need to agree on what success looks like and how it will be measured. It might be\n\nefficiency gains\n\n, cost savings, performance improvements, or new business generated. The clearer the definition, the fairer the distribution of rewards and responsibilities.\n\n2. Map the risks and who owns which part\n\nSome risks relate to execution, others to market shifts, technology, or\n\ncompliance\n\n. The goal is to assign them to the partner best equipped to manage each one. That’s where expertise replaces assumption.\n\n3. Link value to performance\n\nThis is where theory becomes tangible. With risk sharing, payment or reward structures are tied directly to outcomes. It could be through gain-sharing, milestone bonuses, or variable fees linked to results. When performance improves, both sides benefit. If it falls short, both adjust.\n\n4. Keep feedback constant\n\nRisk sharing thrives on continuous feedback, like regular reviews, transparent data, and open discussion. That’s what allows both sides to adapt quickly when conditions change and to keep momentum when they don’t.\n\n5. Build it into culture\n\nThe most successful models go beyond paperwork. They embed shared responsibility into daily operations: how teams communicate (even\n\nextended teams\n\n), how problems are solved, and how success is celebrated. Once that mindset takes root, collaboration becomes a second nature.\n\nHow to reduce the risk in the risk sharing model\n\nWhen managed well, risk becomes part of the design instead of a problem to be solved. Here’s hot to approach it.\n\n1. Start with shared visibility\n\nEveryone involved (from client stakeholders to delivery teams) should see the same numbers, progress, and constraints. Shared visibility keeps decisions grounded in facts, and helps avoid the classic “we thought you meant…” moments that derail projects.\n\n2. Break progress into measurable cycles\n\nInstead of one long road to delivery, projects are divided into smaller checkpoints with tangible outcomes. Each cycle validates assumptions, provides early indicators of performance, and allows quick adjustments before small issues grow into structural risks.\n\n3. Keep KPIs alive\n\nKeep project KPI active, reviewed, and transparent throughout the project so both sides can anticipate shifts in performance and act before they become problems.\n\n4. Align business and technical priorities\n\nRisk often appears in the gap between what the business expects and what’s being built. Continuous dialogue between decision-makers and delivery teams keeps priorities synced, reducing the chance of misaligned outcomes.\n\nRisk sharing with Near Partner\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we approach risk sharing as a framework for measurable success. We start by defining the project scope and business objectives together. From there, we establish KPIs and a baseline, as the foundation for clarity.\n\nOnce the project is in motion, we monitor results over a 3-to-6-month window, validate impact jointly, and activate the reward model when targets are met. It’s a simple equation: shared commitment, shared gain.\n\nIf that sounds like the kind of partnership your organisation needs,\n\nlet’s start the conversation\n\n.",

    "content": "Find out how a Salesforce Audit helps you fix what slows you down and make your CRM work the way your business does.\n\nIt usually starts quietly. A new field here, a quick automation there. Someone adds a report to track a new metric, another person customises a dashboard “just for now.” Months later, the system that once felt sharp and intuitive starts to feel cluttered. Data doesn’t line up. Teams complain that Salesforce is slowing them down instead of helping them move faster.\n\nThat’s when most companies realise something’s off, but few can pinpoint exactly what. Is it the data? The automations? The way people are using it?\n\nThat’s where a Salesforce Audit proves its worth. It’s a focused way to uncover what’s working, what’s not, and how to make your CRM perform the way it was meant to.\n\nIf you’ve ever felt that Salesforce could be doing more for your business, keep reading. This might be the most useful check-up your organisation can do.\n\nWhat is a Salesforce Audit?\n\nA Salesforce Audit is a deep dive into how your Salesforce works for you. It looks at how your teams use it, where data gets stuck, and whether your setup still matches the way your business actually operates today.\n\nOver time, Salesforce tends to collect “digital clutter”: extra fields, old automations, unused reports, custom objects nobody remembers creating. The audit clears that noise, exposes what’s slowing you down, and shows you where the platform can\n\nstart working for you again\n\n, instead of the other way around.\n\nIt’s part detective work, part optimisation, and part strategy session. The goal is to make Salesforce easier to use, more insightful, and perfectly tuned to your goals.\n\nWhy do a Salesforce Audit?\n\nIn short, because Salesforce is never really “done.” It keeps evolving with new users, new processes, new automations. What once made sense can slowly turn into something nobody quite controls. A Salesforce Audit helps you step back and see the full picture.\n\nIdentify inefficiencies\n\nSmall inefficiencies pile up quietly:\n\nduplicate data\n\n,\n\nworkflows\n\nthat trigger twice, manual steps that could be automated. An audit highlights where effort is being wasted and how to make Salesforce simpler, faster, and cleaner.\n\nIncrease adoption\n\nIf your team finds Salesforce confusing, they’ll avoid it. An audit helps uncover what’s getting in their way, like cluttered layouts or irrelevant fields, so you can design an experience people actually want to use.\n\nEnsure compliance and security\n\nUser permissions and data access tend to drift over time. A structured audit brings visibility into who can see what, ensuring your\n\ndata stays protected\n\nand\n\ncompliant\n\nwith internal and external standards.\n\nWhen should you run an audit?\n\nThere’s no “perfect” time, but there are definitely moments when a Salesforce Audit can make all the difference. The truth is, most companies wait until frustration builds up. The best ones don’t. They treat an audit as part of staying sharp.\n\n1. When Salesforce starts to feel heavy\n\nIf your team says Salesforce is “slow,” “messy,” or “not worth the effort,” it’s time. These are usually signs of cluttered data, redundant automations, or confusing processes that have quietly accumulated.\n\n2. Before you scale\n\nGrowth amplifies everything, good and bad. If you’re expanding teams, entering new markets, or launching new products, an audit ensures your foundation is solid before you build on it.\n\n3. When reports stop telling the truth\n\nIf\n\ndashboards\n\nno longer match what’s happening on the ground, you’re probably looking at inconsistent data or misaligned metrics. An audit gets your reporting back to reality.\n\n4. Ahead of a major integration or upgrade\n\nPlanning to connect Salesforce with another platform, or move to a newer version? Auditing first helps you clean the house, avoid\n\ntechnical debt\n\n, and make the transition seamless instead of chaotic.\n\n5. As routine maintenance\n\nJust like you wouldn’t drive a car for years without a service, you shouldn’t let Salesforce run unchecked. A yearly or biannual audit keeps performance high, data healthy, and users happy.\n\nTypes of Salesforce audits\n\nNot every business needs the same kind of audit. Sometimes you need a deep technical clean-up; other times, you just need clarity on how people are using the platform. The best approach depends on what’s holding you back, but here are the main types to consider.\n\nData Audit\n\nA Salesforce data audit uncovers duplicates, outdated records, and inconsistent formats that undermine your reporting and decision-making. The goal is simple: rebuild trust in your data so every number tells the truth.\n\nSecurity & Access Audit\n\nAs teams grow, permissions often drift, leaving data exposed or users with access they no longer need. This audit reviews roles, profiles, and sharing rules to ensure your information stays protected, without slowing down collaboration.\n\nConfiguration Audit\n\nSalesforce setups tend to bloat. Custom fields, workflows, validation rules, triggers, all added with good intentions, but not always with long-term structure. A Configuration Audit identifies what’s essential, what’s redundant, and how to streamline everything for efficiency and clarity.\n\nPerformance Audit\n\nIf Salesforce feels sluggish or processes take too long, a Performance Audit digs into what’s behind it, The result: faster load times, smoother user experience, and more responsive dashboards.\n\nAdoption & Experience Audit\n\nEven the most advanced setup fails if people don’t use it. This audit focuses on behaviour, meaning how teams actually interact with Salesforce day-to-day. It uncovers friction points, training gaps, and UX issues that affect adoption and productivity.\n\nMost companies benefit from a mix of these. A well-rounded Salesforce Audit doesn’t fix isolated issues, but it helps you see how every part of the system connects, so you can create a\n\nCRM that’s powerful and genuinely enjoyable to use\n\n.\n\nSalesforce Audit: the Near Partner way\n\nIf you suspect your Salesforce could be doing more for you, you’re probably right. And we can show you exactly how.\n\nOur approach starts with understanding your business context: what’s working, what’s slowing you down, and where you want to go. Then we bring in our\n\nSalesforce Diagnostic Tool\n\n, a free proprietary audit that analyses your configuration, automations, data quality, and user behaviour. It highlights inefficiencies, redundancies, and risks, giving us a clear picture of where value is leaking.\n\nFrom there, we don’t hand you a 200-page report and say “good luck”. We deliver a ranked list of issues (what needs fixing now, what can wait), practical steps you can act on, organised by impact and effort, and a roadmap that helps you decide whether to address things in phases or take a bigger leap.

    "content": "Modern payments infrastructure powers smooth, secure transactions. Learn how to choose the right setup for your business.\n\nPayments infrastructure can be easily overlooked, until a payment fails, a settlement delays, or a platform can’t scale fast enough. And when that happens, it’s more than just annoying. It affects cash flow, customer trust, and team sanity.\n\nIf you’re building digital products, running a marketplace, managing subscriptions, or just trying to modernize your finance stack, it’s worth getting this part right. Let’s break down what that means.\n\nWhat is payments infrastructure, really?\n\nSimply put, payments infrastructure is the system behind how your business moves money: in, out, across platforms, countries, accounts, and regulatory hurdles. It’s the tech that lets you accept a payment, route it properly, keep it secure, and make sure it shows up where it’s supposed to.\n\nThis includes everything from payment gateways and processors to APIs,\n\ncompliance tools\n\n, fraud detection, reconciliation engines, and\n\nreporting dashboards\n\n. It connects the front-end experience your users see with the back-end controls your finance and ops teams rely on. When it’s done right, no one talks about it, because it just works. When it’s not? Well, everyone’s starts to worry about what’s going on.\n\nSo yes, it’s technical. But it’s also strategic. And if you’re building, scaling, or even just trying to get your payments to behave, this is a layer you can’t afford to ignore.\n\nHow payments infrastructure really works\n\nPayments infrastructure makes sure every transaction moves securely, accurately, and fast from end to end. And that takes a lot of coordination behind the scenes.\n\nAt its core, the process connects three main players: the\n\npayer\n\n(your customer), the\n\npayee\n\n(your company), and a\n\npayment intermediary\n\n(like Stripe or a custom gateway). The transaction flows from the customer’s input through the gateway to the payment processor. It then gets verified by the issuing bank and lands in your merchant account.\n\nTo make this happen, three key steps take place:\n\nAuthorization\n\n: Verifies the customer’s info and approves (or denies) the transaction.\n\nClearing\n\n: Confirms and processes the details, applying any necessary fees.\n\nSettlement\n\n: Actually moves the funds into your account.\n\nSupporting this flow are critical components:\n\nGateways\n\n, which encrypt and transmit data securely.\n\nProcessors\n\n, which handle communication across banks and networks.\n\nMerchant accounts\n\n, which temporarily hold funds before final deposit.\n\nBanks and networks\n\n(Visa, Mastercard, etc.), which make the connections and charge fees in the background.\n\nWhy solid payments infrastructure matters\n\nPayments infrastructure may not be the flashiest part of your stack, but when it’s strong, things just move. And when it’s not, your customers start losing patience. Here’s what a proper setup gets you.\n\nEffortless speed\n\nNo one wants to wait for payments to clear. Not your customers, not your CFO. A solid infrastructure reduces lag, errors, and awkward “where’s my money?” emails.\n\nReconciliation that doesn’t sweep up days\n\nIf you’re still matching transactions manually or switching between dashboards, good infrastructure can give you back hours. Or days.\n\nFewer fires, less risk\n\nFrom fraud detection to compliance checks, modern payments tools bake in security from the start. That means fewer surprises and late-night fixes.\n\nRoom to grow\n\nExpanding into new markets? Adding new revenue streams? A flexible setup means you can scale without duct-taping tools together every time something changes.\n\nA better experience, front to back\n\nSmooth checkout for users, cleaner reporting for finance, less hassle for everyone. It adds up, even if you’re not always noticing it.\n\nOff-the-shelf vs custom-built: which payments infrastructure is right for you?\n\nWhen it comes to payments infrastructure, one of the biggest decisions you’ll face early on is this:\n\nshould you go with a ready-made platform or\n\nbuild something custom\n\n? Here’s how to approach the decision smartly.\n\nOff-the-shelf solutions: fast, but not always flexible\n\nPre-built platforms like Salesforce, Stripe, Adyen, or PayPal are powerful, well-documented, and can get you live fast. If your business model is straightforward (say, standard e-commerce or\n\nSaaS\n\n), these tools cover most bases out of the box.\n\nThey’re great for:\n\nFast go-to-market.\n\nLow initial complexity.\n\nAccess to proven features like fraud protection, local payment methods, and compliance handling.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that off-the-shelf tools weren’t made for\n\nyou\n\n. The more unique your flows, pricing logic, user types, or markets, the more you’ll bump into limitations. Custom logic often requires fragile workarounds. And you might end up paying for features you don’t need or building on top of a tool that wasn’t designed for your model.\n\nCustom infrastructure: built to fit, built to scale\n\nWhen your payment flows are complex, your product is non-standard, or you need\n\ndeep integrations across systems\n\n, a custom setup can give you real leverage. You can design it to reflect your exact logic and automate the right steps.\n\nCustom is ideal when you:\n\nNeed more control over user experience and flow.\n\nHave unique business logic or marketplace architecture.\n\nWant clean integrations with internal systems like ERP,\n\nCRM\n\n, or billing.\n\nSee infrastructure as a strategic differentiator, not just a utility.\n\nIt may take more time upfront, but the payoff is worth considering: less friction,\n\nbetter automation\n\n, and infrastructure that grows with your business instead of getting in the way.\n\nThe smart middle ground: hybrid approaches\n\nSometimes the answer isn’t “either/or.” You can use solid off-the-shelf tools as a foundation and layer custom logic where it matters most, through APIs, middleware, or automation flows.\n\nThis hybrid approach gives you the speed of plug-and-play and the flexibility of tailored design. And it’s where\n\nNear Partner\n\noften steps in: designing automation layers, reconciliation logic, or integration bridges that transform a generic setup into a perfect-fit solution, without reinventing the wheel.\n\nWe can also help you evaluate where you stand, identify where customization creates value, and build what’s missing (without overengineering the rest).\n\nHow to get started with the right payments infrastructure\n\nPicking the right payments infrastructure starts with asking better questions and avoiding quick fixes that become long-term regrets. Here’s how to approach it the smart way.\n\n1. Map your payment ecosystem properly\n\nBefore you even compare platforms or vendors, take the time to map out how money flows through your business. Are you processing one-off payments, subscriptions, marketplace payouts, usage-based billing? Are you receiving funds globally? Splitting revenue between partners? Handling refunds or chargebacks? Document all of it, and not just the ideal path, but the edge cases too.\n\n2. Prioritize flexibility and extensibility\n\nChoose a setup that won’t lock you in. That means APIs that are clear and well-documented, platforms that integrate easily with your stack, and providers that don’t make you beg for feature updates.\n\nLook for modularity\n\n. That means systems that let you swap parts in or out as your needs evolve. Bonus points for providers with good dev support and real roadmaps.\n\n3. Think globally, even if you’re not there yet\n\nIf you plan to expand (or even if international customers find you first) you’ll want infrastructure that supports local payment methods, currency conversion, and regulatory compliance in different regions.\n\nA setup that works beautifully for 100 transactions a month might crumble at 10,000 if it wasn’t built to scale. However, that doesn’t mean you need to go all-in from day one. But choosing infrastructure that’s built for global scale will save you from painful migrations down the line.\n\n4. Don’t sleep on reconciliation and reporting\n\nIt’s tempting to focus only on customer-facing tools, like fast checkout, sleek interfaces, etc. But don’t forget what happens after the payment is made. How is the\n\ndata tracked\n\n? How easy is it to reconcile payments with your accounting systems? What kind of visibility will your finance team have?\n\nAsk about reconciliation tools, export formats, custom reporting, and how easy it is to integrate with your ERP or analytics platform. A lot of platforms fall short here or charge extra for the basics.\n\n5. Consider security, compliance, and support\n\nPCI compliance, anti-fraud measures, transaction monitoring, GDPR… all of it matters. A strong provider should cover most of this by default, but don’t assume. Ask what’s automated, what you’re responsible for, and what happens when something breaks.\n\nAnd don’t underestimate the value of good support. Will you be stuck in a ticket queue? Or do you get real engineers who understand your use case? That support layer becomes critical when money’s not moving, and you need answers fast.\n\n6. Think beyond payments: think integrations\n\nYour payments system has to talk to the rest of your business. Make sure it connects (cleanly!) with the systems your business already uses.\n\nFinance systems (for reconciliation and reporting)\n\nCRMs (for customer-level insights)\n\nBilling platforms (for dunning, invoicing, etc.)\n\nDashboards and alerting (for real-time ops visibility)\n\nThe more these connections are automated and stable, the less fire-fighting your team will have to do. And yes,\n\nNear Partner\n\ncan help you build those bridges, fast and clean.\n\n7. Roll out in phases and stay lean\n\nInstead of launching everything at once, go live with a stable core first: secure, compliant, and reliable payment processing. Then iterate from there. Add reporting, reconciliation tools, dashboards, alerts and automations in smart phases, based on real needs. Measure how things are working before investing in extra complexity.\n\n8. Run a pilot, always\n\nBefore you commit, test. Run a pilot with your real flows, real customers, and real edge cases. This is where all the marketing promises get stress-tested. See how long integration takes, how intuitive the dashboard is, how fast support responds, and how your finance team handles the data.\n\nA provider that can’t handle your complexity at a small scale definitely won’t manage it at full speed.\n\n9, Monitor, iterate, improve\n\nOnce you’re live, the work isn’t over. Track what’s working. Keep an eye on errors, drop-offs, latency, and edge cases. Look at your support tickets. Listen to users.\n\nAnd then tweak. Iterate. Optimize. That’s how you turn infrastructure into advantage.\n\nWhat’s next for payments infrastructure?\n\nThe competition is heating up between banks, fintechs, and big tech, and innovation is being driven by both customer expectations and emerging technologies. Here’s what’s on the horizon (and already knocking at your door):\n\nOmnichannel is non-negotiable\n\n: Online, in-store, mobile: the line is gone. Payments need to flow seamlessly across all channels.\n\nDigital wallets are booming\n\n: Apple Pay, Google Pay and others are dominating checkout screens. Support them, or risk being left behind.\n\nBiometrics are the new password\n\n: Face, fingerprint, voice: expect security and speed in one move.\n\nAI is doing the heavy lifting\n\n: From fraud prevention to smarter risk management and personalized payment experiences.\n\nReal-time payments\n\nare becoming the standard. Instant, frictionless, and great for both your customers and your cash flow.\n\nCrypto and IoT\n\naren’t mainstream (yet), but they’re gaining ground. If your market or customers lean that way, stay prepared.\n\nNeed a partner that knows payments infrastructure inside and out?\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we help teams go from “we need something better” to “we’ve got this sorted.” We help you:\n\nUnderstand what kind of payments infrastructure you need.\n\nDesign custom integrations that work with your stack.\n\nImplement automation that’s reliable, maintainable, and scalable.\n\nWe handle the full implementation with your team, to make sure your payments setup is efficient, scalable, and built to last.\n\nGet in touch\n\nand let’s build the right way.

    "content": "Revenue Lifecycle Management software can simplify sales and boost recurring revenue. Here’s how to choose the right one for your business.\n\nQuoting takes too long. Pricing feels inconsistent. Invoices get delayed, renewals slip through the cracks, and finance spends hours\n\nreconciling revenue\n\nmanually.\n\nIf any of that sounds familiar, you’re not alone. As more businesses move to recurring revenue models and complex service offerings, the traditional sales-to-cash process starts to break.\n\nThat’s where Revenue Lifecycle Management software stands out. In this guide, we’ll walk through what it does and how it simplifies complexity and unlocks more predictable growth.\n\nWhat is Revenue Lifecycle Management Software\n\nRevenue Lifecycle Management software helps businesses manage every stage of the revenue process, from the first quote to renewals, in one connected system.\n\nThat includes:\n\nProduct and pricing setup\n\nQuoting and contracting\n\nOrder management and billing\n\nRevenue recognition and compliance\n\nRenewals and upselling\n\nInstead of relying on spreadsheets, emails, and disconnected tools, RLM brings structure and visibility to the entire revenue cycle. You can see where deals stand, track revenue more accurately, and respond faster to changes.\n\nSource:\n\nsalesforce\n\nIt’s especially valuable for companies with recurring revenue, complex product catalogues, or strict\n\ncompliance requirements\n\n. Think healthcare, telecom, or software-as-a-service.\n\nWhy Revenue Lifecycle Software matters\n\nThe real benefit of Revenue Lifecycle Management Software? It brings structure to a part of your business that often runs on fragmented tools, ad hoc approvals, and back-and-forth emails. Here’s what the right system can do:\n\nBring clarity to pricing and product offerings\n\nNo more hunting for the latest price list or wondering which discount rules apply. Everything’s in one place, version-controlled and accessible.\n\nFonte:\n\nSalesforce\n\nSpeed up quote-to-cash\n\nAutomate approvals, generate contracts in seconds, and eliminate the lag between a verbal “yes” and a signed deal.\n\nReduce revenue leakage\n\nSmall inconsistencies in pricing, billing delays, and manual errors add up, and fast. A good system keeps things consistent, traceable, and auditable.\n\nAlign sales, finance and legal\n\nThese teams don’t always speak the same language, but when they work from the same source of truth, alignment becomes much easier.\n\nSupport complex models\n\nWhether it’s subscriptions, usage-based pricing, multi-year contracts or bundles, it handles the logic, so your team doesn’t have to.\n\nThe limits of Revenue Lifecycle Software\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong? Well, as powerful as Revenue Lifecycle Management software can be, it’s not always the silver bullet people hope for. Here’s where things can get tricky:\n\n1. You can’t automate what you don’t understand\n\nThrowing software at a messy process won’t fix it. It just makes the mess more visible. If your quoting, pricing, or billing logic isn’t clear, no tool will solve that for you. The system needs structured inputs.\n\n2. Customization creep is real\n\nIt’s tempting to tweak everything to match how your team\n\ncurrently\n\nworks. But over-customizing often leads to bloated systems that are hard to maintain or upgrade. You end up boxed in by your own “flexibility”.\n\n3. It still needs people\n\nPeople still need to validate exceptions, handle edge cases, and adjust pricing strategies. A good system supports your team, and does not replace them.\n\n4. Integration isn’t always plug-and-play\n\nYes, most tools claim they “integrate seamlessly” with your CRM, ERP or billing systems. But do the reality? Expect some work.\n\nData cleanup\n\n, mapping, and change management are all part of the journey.\n\n5. It can be expensive if badly scoped\n\nPoorly defined requirements lead to overbuilt systems, delayed implementations and underwhelming results. Without a clear scope and phased approach, your budget can disappear fast.\n\nBuy or build? Choosing between off-the-shelf and custom Revenue Lifecycle Software\n\nWhen you’re ready to adopt Revenue Lifecycle Management software, one of the first big questions is: should we buy a ready-made solution or build one tailored to our needs? There’s no one-size-fits-all answer, so here’s how to weigh the trade-offs.\n\nOff-the-shelf: fast, proven, but sometimes frustrating\n\nPre-built solutions like Salesforce CPQ are great when you want to move quickly and adopt established best practices. They’re tested, supported, regularly updated, and often come with built-in integrations.\n\nHowever, you’ll need to adapt your processes to the tool, not the other way around. And if your business model is even slightly unconventional, you may end up forcing workarounds or battling limitations that slow your team down.\n\nGood fit for:\n\ncompanies with relatively standard quoting, pricing, and billing flows who want fast deployment and predictable costs.\n\nBuilt-from-scratch: tailored precision, but higher stakes\n\nCustom-built solutions\n\ngive you full control. Every screen, rule, and flow can match your reality. If your pricing models are complex or if you need to integrate with internal systems that off-the-shelf tools don’t handle well, this might be the way to go.\n\nOf course, building from scratch takes time. And discipline. Without a clear scope and experienced team, it’s easy to end up reinventing features that commercial tools already nailed.\n\nGood fit for:\n\ncompanies with unique processes or highly specific regulatory/compliance needs, and with the bandwidth to support a proper development cycle.\n\nHow to get started\n\nRevenue Lifecycle Management sounds complex and, let’s be honest, it can be. But the trick is to focus on impact and not just features. Here’s how to do that in practice:\n\n1. Map your revenue flow\n\nStart by breaking down your existing revenue journey:\n\nWhere does a deal start?\n\nWhat steps does it go through (quote, approval, invoicing, renewal)?\n\nWhere are things slow, manual, or error-prone?\n\nEven a rough sketch on paper is a powerful first step. This clarity helps you focus your effort where it’ll count.\n\n2. Prioritise pain points\n\nYou don’t need to fix everything at once. Choose one or two high-impact problems to solve first.  Look for:\n\nBottlenecks that slow down deals\n\nGaps where revenue is lost (e.g., missed renewals, inconsistent pricing)\n\nCompliance risks or reporting headaches\n\n3. Audit your existing tools\n\nBefore adding more tools to the mix, take stock of what’s already in play. You might have a\n\nCRM here\n\n, an ERP there, a quoting tool no one really loves, and yet they’re all part of the same revenue puzzle.\n\nLook at how these systems talk to each other (or don’t), where data gets stuck, and what processes are still painfully manual. This is a chance to find hidden efficiencies, spot what’s dragging you down, and make sure you’re not paying for things that don’t deliver.\n\n4. Define what “better” looks like\n\nGo beyond features. Define what a better process should feel like:\n\nFaster quote-to-cash?\n\nFewer manual approvals?\n\nReal-time visibility into revenue projections?\n\n5. Get the right voices in the room\n\nDon’t wait until you’re knee-deep in implementation to ask sales, finance or ops what’s broken. They’re the ones who hit roadblocks every day: the approval delays, the pricing inconsistencies, the double data entry.\n\nBringing them in from the start it’s how you avoid building something polished that solves the wrong problems. Plus, involving the right people early tends to make adoption much smoother later.\n\n6. Start small, but aim wide\n\nYou don’t need to rebuild your entire revenue process overnight. The smartest approach? Pick one area where the pain is sharp and the impact will be felt fast. But whatever you roll out, make sure it’s designed to scale. That means\n\nintegrations\n\nwon’t be a nightmare, user roles won’t get messy, and you’re not setting yourself up for a second rebuild in a year.\n\nWhy Salesforce CPQ might be your shortcut to RLM done right\n\nIf Revenue Lifecycle Management feels overwhelming, you’re not alone. Sales processes, pricing approvals, contract management, revenue recognition – they often live in different tools (or spreadsheets) that barely talk to each other.\n\nSalesforce CPQ\n\nbrings the structure your revenue ops need.\n\nSalesforce CPQ (Configure, Price, Quote) helps you streamline everything from product configuration and discount approvals to generating contracts and syncing data with finance. You won’t have to chase legal every time you need the latest template. Manual copy-paste mistakes become a thing of the past. And complex deals flow smoothly without holdups.\n\nHere’s what makes Salesforce CPQ a strong foundation for Revenue Lifecycle Management:\n\nSpeed and accuracy at scale.\n\nSales teams can build quotes in minutes, not days, with pricing rules and product bundles that actually reflect your business.\n\nAutomation that removes friction.\n\nApproval workflows, renewals, upsell triggers, contract generation – they all happen in the background, reducing admin and human error.\n\nIntegration with Salesforce CRM and beyond.\n\nYou keep a single source of truth from lead to renewal, with visibility across teams and stages.\n\nFlexibility to evolve.\n\nNeed to integrate with billing, ERP or custom product logic? Salesforce CPQ plays well with others and grows with you.\n\nNeed help making Revenue Lifecycle Management Software work?\n\nIf you want to stop wrestling with fragmented revenue processes and get your lifecycle running smoothly, you’re in the right place.\n\nAt Near Partner, we go beyond implementing software. We partner with you to design revenue management that’s smart, scalable, and built around your real business challenges. We’ll help you connect the dots between systems, make your pricing logic work in real life, and design workflows that help teams move faster, not just add more steps.\n\nGet in touch\n\nand let’s make your revenue lifecycle work for you.",

    "content": "Everyone’s trying vibe coding, but is it really that simple? Find out what it is, its pros and cons, and how to do it right.\n\nYou had an idea, typed it into an AI assistant, and minutes later you had working code. No devs, no delays, no meetings. Just results.\n\nAt least, that’s what it looked like, until things stopped working. Or worse, something broke and you didn’t know how to fix it. That’s the promise and the danger of vibe coding: it gives you just enough to get started, but not enough to do it right.\n\nIn this article, we’re unpacking the vibe coding trend: what it is, why it’s growing, and why going solo with AI tools isn’t always the smart move. Especially when performance, security, or long-term reliability matter.\n\nWhat is vibe coding?\n\nVibe coding is what happens when non-developers use AI tools like Cursor, Windsurf or\n\nGitHub Copilot\n\nto write code based on natural\n\nlanguage prompts\n\n– often without understanding how that code actually works.\n\nIt feels empowering. You describe what you want, the AI gives you code, and you see it running within minutes. But beneath the surface, there’s often a fragile setup held together by guesses, assumptions, and untested logic.\n\nBenefits of vibe coding\n\nThere’s a reason vibe coding is popping up in hackathons, pitch decks and Slack channels: it feels like the future. AI tools are closing the gap between intention and execution, and for anyone who’s ever had an idea but didn’t know how to code, it seems magical.\n\nIt feels fast\n\nOne prompt in, working code out. That sense of instant progress is incredibly rewarding. Need a form? A database? An API call? You ask, and the AI delivers, skipping planning, research, or even design. When you’re exploring ideas, this speed is energising.\n\nIt’s cheap\n\nHiring developers takes time and budget. Vibe coding seems to remove both barriers. Why spend on a prototype when you can piece it together yourself over a weekend with free tools?\n\nIt feels accessible\n\nAnyone can write “build me a form that sends data to a spreadsheet”, and get something that\n\nkind of\n\nworks. That’s a big deal for marketers, founders, product leads, even interns. It gives people a way to get involved. But it also blurs the line between usable and reliable, between “it runs” and “it’s robust”.\n\nIt hides the complexity\n\nVibe coding gives you the output, not the understanding. There’s no learning curve, no documentation, no architecture decisions. That’s the point… and the problem. You get working pieces, but no structure. No separation of concerns. No safety nets.\n\nLimitations of vibe coding\n\nBeneath the surface, a dangerous reality may be taking shape: fragile code, without technical criteria, or minimum guarantees of security, performance or maintainability. Here’s where things get threatening.\n\nSecurity is almost always an afterthought\n\nCode generated by AI tools often lacks even the most basic security best practices. No input validation. No protection against common vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL injection or CSRF. And because the person using the tool may not know what to check for, these risks can go completely unnoticed, until there’s a breach.\n\nPerformance bottlenecks show up late\n\nWhen you’re testing alone or with a handful of users, almost anything seems fast enough. But once your product hits real traffic, inefficient logic, unoptimized queries or poorly structured DOM manipulation can create massive slowdowns. And because the code wasn’t designed with scale in mind, there’s often no easy fix.\n\nFragile architecture\n\nVibe coding tends to generate isolated bits of code (components that work in the moment, but aren’t part of any overarching system). There’s no codebase cohesion. No version control. No documentation. When it breaks (and it will), there’s no structure to fall back on, and often no clear path to fix it.\n\nInvisible tech debt\n\nThe cost of technical decisions doesn’t show up on day one. It creeps in: when adding new features becomes harder than expected, when bugs are unpredictable, or when your team can’t understand the code well enough to improve it. That “quick solution” now comes with months of headaches.\n\nCompliance risks\n\nEspecially in industries like\n\nhealthcare\n\n,\n\nfinance\n\nor education, software has to comply with strict data, accessibility, or auditability standards. Vibe coding doesn’t account for any of this. And without a proper development partner, you might not even realise you’re non-compliant.\n\nHow to use vibe coding\n\nUsed carefully, vibe coding can be a helpful tool, but it’s not plug-and-play magic. If you’re going to explore it, treat it like a sharp object: it can do great things, but only if you handle it with care.\n\nUse it to explore ideas\n\nIf you’re still sketching out a product or testing whether something makes sense, vibe coding can be incredibly useful. You can ask for a quick landing page, a demo form, or a mock interface.\n\nSay you want to test how users react to a new booking flow. Instead of waiting for a dev sprint, you generate a working prototype with vibe coding, get feedback, then hand over real requirements to your development team.\n\nAlways test it yourself, properly\n\nAI-generated code often “looks” right, but can break in quiet, dangerous ways. Don’t just click the button once and assume it works. Try wrong inputs. Try edge cases. Try breaking it. Use dev tools (browser console, network tab) and validation checkers (like WAVE for accessibility or Lighthouse for performance) to really see what’s going on under the hood.\n\nAsk someone technical to review it\n\nEven if you’re not planning to release it publicly, don’t skip peer review. AI-generated code can hide performance issues, insecure patterns (like unsanitised inputs), or practices that will make maintenance harder later.\n\nShare your generated code with a developer you trust. Ask: “Would this hold up in production?” Their reaction will tell you a lot.\n\nUse it as a way to learn, not shortcut\n\nInstead of just copying and pasting, try asking follow-up questions: why did it use this method? What could go wrong with this approach?\n\nThe more you learn, the less you’ll rely on luck, and the better decisions you’ll make when things get complicated.\n\nIs vibe coding right for you?\n\nBefore jumping in, ask yourself: is this the right tool for the job, or just the most tempting?\n\nIt might be the right fit if…\n\nYou’re working solo on a small idea or internal tool\n\nYou need a quick prototype to present or validate\n\nYou’re building something low-risk (no user data, no payments, no logins)\n\nYou understand that you’ll need to rewrite the code later\n\nProbably not a good match if…\n\nYou’re working in a regulated industry\n\nYou want to scale the code, integrate APIs, or maintain it long-term\n\nYou can’t risk downtime, security breaches, or poor performance\n\nAlternatives to vibe coding\n\nNot all fast development means risky shortcuts.

    "content": "System integration offers huge gains, but many projects still fail. See how to unlock real ROI, carefully and with strategy.\n\nIn October 2022, just ahead of the all-important Christmas spending season,\n\nmultinational retailer Spar unveiled their flagship SAP project\n\n. Touted as a landmark transformation, the system was meant to position the company for a decade of growth and revolutionize its relationship with distributors. Instead, it became a cautionary tale in system integration.\n\nProblems surfaced almost immediately. Severe supply chain disruptions rippled across the business. Independent Spar retailers in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), who had long relied on centralized operations, suddenly had to source stock directly from manufacturers or alternative suppliers. To contain the crisis, Spar diverted inventory from warehouses in other provinces—an expensive and inefficient stopgap.\n\nBy September 2023, the consequences were staggering: an estimated 100 million in lost turnover. Recovery would take years of painstaking manual intervention.\n\nSpar’s missteps are hardly unique. Large-scale system integrations can radically reshape how companies operate, but they almost never succeed with the flick of a switch. In fact,\n\nonly one in three digital transformation initiatives\n\never meet their intended goals.\n\nThe culprit is often not the technology itself, but the lack of planning, alignment, cultural readiness, and change management. And if global giants like Spar can stumble, what chance do smaller organizations have when embarking on a digital integration journey?\n\nThe good news: success is possible. There are practical strategies you can adopt—and classic pitfalls you can avoid. Here are some of the most important ones.\n\nWhat do we mean by system integration?\n\nAt its core,\n\nsystem integration\n\nis about making different software and platforms work together as one. Instead of having your\n\nCRM\n\n, ERP, HR system, and\n\ncloud apps\n\noperating in isolation (each with its own data and workflows), integration connects them into a single, unified ecosystem.\n\nThat means customer data flows seamlessly from sales to finance,\n\nsupply chain\n\nupdates are visible in real time, and reporting no longer requires endless copy-paste marathons. In other words, system integration eliminates silos and replaces them with a connected backbone where information moves freely, accurately, and securely across the business.\n\nThe benefits of system integration that companies actually feel\n\nSystem integration often gets framed as a “tech upgrade,” but the real story is much bigger. The impact shows up in day-to-day operations, employee productivity, customer experience and, ultimately, the bottom line. Here’s what businesses stand to gain.\n\n1. Efficiency without the busywork\n\nNo more\n\nduplicate data\n\nentry or switching between five different platforms to complete a single task. When systems talk to each other, workflows become seamless, freeing teams from the manual work that eats away hours every week. It’s like finally removing the sand from the gears. Everything just moves faster.\n\n2. Data that flows (and tells the truth)\n\nOne of the biggest headaches for growing companies is scattered, inconsistent data. Integration creates a single source of truth, ensuring finance, sales, operations, and HR are all looking at the same numbers. Decisions become sharper because they’re based on real-time, reliable information rather than gut instinct or outdated spreadsheets.\n\n3. Smarter (and faster) decisions\n\nExecutives no longer need to wait for “end-of-month reports” to know what’s happening. With connected systems,\n\ndata dashboards\n\nupdate in real time. That means spotting risks earlier, reacting to market shifts quicker, and seizing opportunities before competitors do.\n\n4. Better customer experience\n\nWhen your CRM, billing, and support platforms work in harmony, customers notice. Faster responses, fewer errors, personalized interactions – it all adds up to stronger trust and loyalty. In fact, research shows that companies with connected data\n\noutperform competitors\n\nin customer satisfaction and retention.\n\n5. Easier scalability\n\nGrowth usually means adding more tools, people, and processes. Without integration, that can spiral into digital anarchy. But with a connected backbone, scaling feels less like firefighting and more like building on solid ground. New systems plug in smoothly, data keeps flowing, and teams don’t drown in complexity.\n\nThe limitations of system integration you can’t afford to ignore\n\nSystem integration comes with its own set of challenges that companies need to plan for. Being aware of these limitations is the first step to overcoming them.\n\n1. Compatibility issues between systems\n\nNot all platforms play nicely together. Legacy systems, outdated software, or heavily customized tools can make integration tricky. Sometimes it means extra middleware, custom development, or even retiring older systems altogether.\n\n2. Security and compliance risks\n\nEvery connection between systems is also a potential vulnerability. If integration isn’t handled with proper safeguards, it can expose sensitive data to breaches or compliance issues, especially in sectors like\n\nfinance\n\nor\n\nhealthcare\n\nwhere regulations are strict.\n\n3. Change management hurdles\n\nThe tech may be ready, but people aren’t always on board. Employees used to manual workflows or siloed systems may resist change, making training and communication critical to a smooth rollout. No doubt that integration connects software, but it also should bring people along too.\n\n4. Maintenance and continuous updates\n\nOnce systems are integrated, they don’t stay static. Updates, new platforms, and changing business needs mean integrations must be maintained and adapted over time. Without ongoing support, even the best integration can become outdated or fragile.\n\nAI in system integration\n\nWith AI stepping in, the mechanics of system integration look very different than they did a few years ago. Intelligent agents can now act as the “connective tissue” between platforms, automating data flows, monitoring system health, and even making decisions in real time. Instead of relying only on traditional APIs or manual intervention, companies are experimenting with AI-driven orchestration to speed up processes and unlock new efficiencies.\n\nThe benefits are clear: faster integrations, reduced human error, and the ability to scale connections across increasingly complex environments. An AI agent can, for example, detect when data looks inconsistent between systems, correct it on the fly, and prevent downstream errors. It can also learn patterns over time, predicting when bottlenecks or failures might occur, which is something static integration models can’t do.\n\nAI-driven integration also brings risks: opaque decision-making, over-reliance on algorithms that might misinterpret context, and regulatory or compliance challenges when sensitive data is involved. A misconfigured or poorly trained agent can spread errors faster than a human ever could.\n\nIn short, AI opens a powerful new chapter for system integration, but one that requires caution, governance, and a clear understanding of its limitations. The companies that thrive will be those that balance automation with oversight, ensuring technology augments human judgment rather than replacing it.\n\nSystem Integration implementation: a step-by-step guide\n\nHere’s a practical roadmap to get system integration right.\n\n1. Map your business processes, not just systems\n\nBefore you touch any software, map the\n\nworkflows\n\nand business processes that span multiple systems. Identify dependencies, bottlenecks, and pain points. Integration succeeds when it reflects real business activity, not just IT architecture.\n\n2. Audit data quality and consistency\n\nIntegration is only as good as the data flowing through it. Identify inconsistencies, duplicates, or gaps across systems before building connections. Dirty data leads to automated mess, instead of streamlined operations.\n\n3. Define clear integration objectives\n\nKnow what “success” looks like. Are you aiming for faster reporting, fewer errors, or better\n\ncustomer experience\n\n? Setting measurable goals ensures ROI is tangible and the project doesn’t drift into a generic IT exercise.\n\n4. Choose the right integration approach\n\nDecide between real-time vs. batch, point-to-point vs. middleware, or API-first approaches depending on complexity and scale. Avoid the trap of copying legacy workflows into automation, because it often amplifies inefficiencies.\n\n5. Design for security and compliance\n\nEvery connection introduces\n\npotential vulnerabilities\n\n. Plan security measures, access controls, and audit trails from day one. This protects both the business and customer trust.\n\n6. Pilot, test, and iterate\n\nStart small with a pilot integration. Test for performance, edge cases, and unexpected behaviors. Involve end-users early to catch usability issues. Iterate before full-scale rollout to avoid costly mistakes.\n\n7. Train teams and drive adoption\n\nEven the most elegant integration fails if people don’t use it. Train employees, provide support materials, and incentivize adoption. Highlight how integration simplifies their work, rather than just presenting it as a technical change.\n\n8. Monitor, maintain, and evolve\n\nContinuously monitor performance, update for new tools or business needs, and refine workflows to ensure long-term value.\n\nLow-code solutions for system integration\n\nConnecting systems no longer means months of custom coding. Low-code and no-code platforms have rewritten the rulebook. Instead of relying solely on custom code and large development teams, businesses now have the option to connect tools quickly using visual interfaces, prebuilt connectors, and automation engines. Here’s a closer look at the main players and how they fit into different business needs.\n\nOutSystems\n\n, for exemple, takes things up a level, offering a full low-code development platform that includes integration capabilities. It can build full systems and extend existing infrastructures. Enterprises that need scalability, governance, and complex system integrations. You can build custom applications while still speeding up delivery through low-code.\n\nSalesforce\n\noffers its own suite of integration capabilities, from MuleSoft to native connectors. For organizations already living inside Salesforce, these tools make it possible to unify data across departments and streamline customer journeys.\n\nSystem integration with Near Partner\n\nSystem integration has the power to transform the way a company operates and unlock its full potential.\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we craft connected ecosystems that reflect how your business actually works.

    "content": "is, why it is important and how to do it right with practical insights.\n\nYou sent a technician out at 9:00. By 11:00, the client is calling to ask where they are. Your internal tracker says the job’s done. The technician hasn’t even arrived. Somewhere between the scheduling tool, the service app and the chat group, the thread got lost.\n\nThis is the kind of everyday chaos that eats away at\n\nefficiency\n\n, client trust and your team’s sanity. And it’s more common than most companies care to admit. Field service management shouldn’t feel like a high-stakes guessing game. So let’s talk about what’s really going wrong — and what to do when your operations keep hitting the same wall.\n\nField Service Management is the coordination of resources — people, equipment and information — when work needs to be done on-site. Think installations, repairs, maintenance and inspections. It involves scheduling, dispatching, tracking, reporting and everything in between.\n\nWhat is Field Service Management?\n\nA well-oiled Field Service Management system means less time wasted, more accurate work,\n\nbetter client experience\n\nand real-time visibility over what’s happening out in the field. However, very few companies actually get it right.\n\n8 signs you need to improve your Field Service Management (and what to do about it)\n\nBelow are some of the main sticking points — and how we usually help untangle the mess.\n\n1. Scheduling Is a nightmare: too many jobs, not enough context\n\nSchedulers are trying to match technicians to tasks without the full picture. Skillsets, availability, location, job urgency — none of it is centralised or easy to act on. The result? Overbookings, idle time or wrong person for the job.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nInvest in a scheduling solution that lets you visualise workloads, technician skills and availability in real time. Avoid static calendars or overcomplicated tools.\n\n2. Your systems don’t talk to each other\n\nYou’ve got CRM in one place, job tracking in another, technician notes in a third tool, and Excel patching the gaps. By the time you know something went wrong, it already escalated.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nmap out all the tools currently in use and identify where information is getting lost. Prioritise systems that can be integrated, or replaced, so data flows between them without manual effort.\n\n3. Technicians waste time on admin tasks\n\nTechnicians spend too long writing reports, dealing with clunky mobile tools or calling in to confirm basic info. That’s time better spent on actual work — and they know it.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nLook for mobile tools designed specifically for field work — fast to use, intuitive, and capable of working offline.\n\n4. Clients are always in the dark\n\nYour client expected someone by 10:00. It’s 10:40. They haven’t heard anything. You don’t even know if the technician’s stuck in traffic or forgot the job. It’s a trust issue, and one that costs you repeat business.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nSet up automated notifications at key stages of the service: appointment confirmed, technician en route, job completed. Transparency doesn’t have to be manual, and clients will notice.\n\n5. Data is collected but never used\n\nYou’re collecting a mountain of data: service times, repeat issues, technician efficiency. But no one’s analysing it. Opportunities for improvement are buried in dashboards no one opens.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nIdentify a few key metrics you actually care about, and make them visible. Build regular habits around reviewing them and acting on trends.\n\n6. No standard process across teams\n\nEach technician has their own way of doing things. Some document everything, others don’t bother. One team follows procedure, the other cuts corners. The result? Inconsistency, confusion, and no way to scale quality.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nDefine a standard workflow for the most common job types and make it easy to follow — digitally.\n\nStep-by-step guidance\n\n, checklists and required fields can help build consistency without policing your team.\n\n7. Onboarding new technicians takes forever\n\nWhen know-how lives in people’s heads, new technicians are stuck shadowing others for weeks. Even after that, they’re unsure about protocols, tools or what’s expected of them in the field.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nCreate a lightweight knowledge base with clear job procedures, quick-reference guides and troubleshooting tips.\n\nPair it with a simple digital assistant or app\n\nso new joiners can learn on the move.\n\n8. Equipment and inventory go untracked\n\nParts go missing, tools are misplaced, and no one knows who has what. Some techs stock their vans like warehouses, others show up empty-handed. You lose time, money, and sometimes clients.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nImplement a basic asset\n\ntracking system\n\n(ideally mobile) where technicians can log what they take and return.\n\nWhat does a good field service tool look like?\n\nThe right solution should solve real problems and take the pressure off both your frontline and back office. So before you choose a platform (or build one), here’s what actually matters.\n\nWhat does a good field service tool look like?\n\nThe right FSM software should solve real problems and take the pressure off both your frontline and back office. In other words, a good field service management (FSM) solution should make field service operations run smoother, keep your mobile workforce productive, and ultimately improve customer satisfaction. So before you choose a platform (or build one), here’s what actually matters.\n\nReal-time scheduling and dispatch\n\nShowing up matters. Showing up fast matters more. And with context. You should be able to assign jobs based on availability, location, skillset, and priority, all in real time. Bonus if the system can reassign on the fly when someone calls in sick or a job runs over. This kind of agility keeps service calls under control and ensures customers aren’t left waiting.\n\nMobile experience\n\nYour mobile workers are the ones using this tool all day long, so make it work for them. That means offline access, fast check-ins, simple data entry, and straightforward navigation. If they’re spending more time figuring out how to update a job than doing the job, it’s the wrong tool. The best FSM software turns every technician’s phone or tablet into a true command center for their work.\n\nClear job overviews and live status updates\n\nFrom “assigned” to “in progress” to “done,” you want to see where each job stands without needing a dozen phone calls. What if a client wants an update? With proper customer management built in, you should have that info at your fingertips, from status to service history, in seconds.\n\nEasy logging of work done, issues found, and customer feedback\n\nYour team should be able to document their work (photos, signatures, notes, time spent) without friction. That data is gold for follow-ups, reporting, and continuous improvement. When linked with customer management features, these logs also ensure you’re not asking customers the same questions twice.\n\nSmart asset and inventory management\n\nWho has what, where is it, and is it working? A solid tool should help you track parts, tools and equipment, so your technicians aren’t showing up unprepared or hoarding gear “just in case.” This also supports preventive maintenance, since you can plan ahead rather than constantly reacting to breakdowns.\n\nBuilt-in quality control\n\nYou can’t be everywhere at once. But your tool can help enforce standards: checklists, required fields, automated alerts when something’s missing or off. It may sound micromanaging, but, in fact, it’s really protecting quality at scale and making sure field service operations don’t slip through the cracks.\n\nReports and KPIs\n\nYou shouldn’t need a data analyst to understand what’s going on. A good tool gives you useful insights: average time per job, repeat visits, technician performance, bottlenecks, so you can fix what’s not working. When connected to your field service management (FSM) platform, these insights can directly highlight where to act to improve customer satisfaction.\n\nSeamless integrations with the tools you already use\n\nYour CRM, billing system, customer service tools – they all need to talk to your field service management FSM platform. No double entries. No manual copy-paste. Just data that flows, giving everyone, from mobile workers to back-office staff, a complete view of the service history and every interaction that matters.\n\nWhat are the best Salesforce-based solutions for field service?\n\nIf your business already\n\nruns on Salesforce\n\n, you don’t have to start from scratch. There are several field service solutions that plug right in, extending what you already use and eliminating most of the integration pain. But each one plays a different role. Here’s a breakdown of the main players, and when it makes sense to choose them.\n\nSalesforce Field Service (FSL)\n\nThis is Salesforce’s own native solution, and it covers the end-to-end field service lifecycle: from scheduling and dispatch, to real-time tracking, mobile access, inventory management, and customer communication.\n\nIt’s ideal if:\n\nYou already use Service Cloud or Sales Cloud.\n\nYou want a consistent experience across teams.\n\nYour processes are fairly standard but growing in complexity.\n\nKey benefits:\n\nNative integration with Salesforce CRM.\n\nDrag-and-drop scheduling board.\n\nReal-time updates and smart job matching.\n\nMobile app with offline support.\n\nSitetracker\n\nSitetracker\n\nwas built for companies that run dozens, sometimes hundreds of projects at the same time. If you’re in telecom, energy, or infrastructure and need to keep everything on track without losing sight of the details, this platform gives you that clarity. You can count on deployment schedules, resource allocation, real-time reporting, and much more. Sitetracker helps you stay in control, even when things get complex.\n\nIt’s ideal if:\n\nYou manage lots of concurrent field projects with multiple milestones.\n\nYou need consistent reporting and forecasting across teams.\n\nYou’re scaling fast and can’t afford operational blind spots.\n\nKey benefits:\n\nProject templates and standardised workflows for repeatability.\n\nReal-time dashboards for progress, risks, and resources.\n\nMobile tools for field teams with status updates and photo capture.\n\nSeamless integrations with CRMs, ERPs, and inventory systems.\n\nSimplify Workflows\n\nSimplify Workflows is for teams that want to move faster and with less friction. Instead of waiting weeks for custom solutions or juggling spreadsheets, you can turn your field processes into automated workflows in just a few clicks. It’s flexible, intuitive, and designed for people who know the process, not necessarily how to code it.\n\nIt’s ideal if:\n\nYou want to digitise manual workflows without custom builds.\n\nYour team needs automation that’s easy to set up and adjust.\n\nYou want to empower non-technical users to optimise processes.\n\nKey benefits:\n\nIntuitive drag-and-drop builder for process automation.\n\nSmart forms, notifications, and dynamic task assignment.\n\nReal-time visibility into workflow status and performance.\n\nFlexible integrations with tools you already use.\n\nField Service Management tools: build or buy?\n\nIt’s the big question that comes after identifying your needs: do you buy an existing platform, or build something tailored to your operations? There’s no universal answer. But there are clear scenarios where one approach makes more sense than the other.\n\nHere’s how to weigh the decision.\n\nWhen to buy off the shelf\n\nBuying a ready-made solution is usually faster, safer, and more predictable. Most tools (like Salesforce Field Service or ServiceMax) already cover 80–90% of what typical businesses need. And if you’re already working with Salesforce, the integration can be nearly seamless.\n\nChoose this path if:\n\nYour business model isn’t wildly unusual.\n\nYou want speed and lower upfront costs.\n\nYour internal tech team is small or focused elsewhere.\n\nYou’d rather adapt slightly than reinvent everything.\n\nThe trade-off? You may have to compromise on some edge cases, or pay for features you won’t fully use. But if speed, stability, and vendor support matter most, you’ll win more than you’ll lose.\n\nWhen it makes sense to build your own\n\nSometimes, your operation is simply too specific for a generic solution to fit well. Maybe your workflows are niche, your service areas are complex, or your internal processes are highly regulated. In those cases,\n\nbuilding something tailored\n\n— perhaps with a\n\nlow-code platform like OutSystems\n\n— can bring massive advantages.\n\nChoose this path if:\n\nOff-the-shelf tools feel too rigid or bloated.\n\nYou need full control over every process, screen and field.\n\nYou have internal capabilities (or a trusted partner) to maintain the platform.\n\nYou want to innovate or differentiate through the way you deliver service.\n\nWhere’s the compromise? Time, budget and maintenance. Custom builds require clear ownership, ongoing updates, and a higher tolerance for iteration. But if you get it right, the tool becomes a real competitive asset.\n\nNot sure yet? Consider a hybrid\n\nYou don’t always have to choose one or the other. Some companies start with an off-the-shelf tool and\n\ncustomise around the edges\n\nusing low-code extensions. Others prototype in-house, then migrate to a mature platform once needs are stable.\n\nThe key is to stay close to what your teams and clients actually need, and make sure your choice doesn’t become a blocker six months down the line.\n\nReady to make Field Service Management work like it should?\n\nIf your Field Service Management feels more reactive than strategic, it’s probably not the team — it’s the system. With the right setup, things start to click: teams know where to go, clients stay informed, and data actually works for you.\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we design and build the custom platforms that make all of this possible. Sharp, scalable solutions that fit your business, and a smarter way to manage work in the real world.\n\nWant to talk through where your current setup might be holding you back?\n\nLet’s have that conversation\n\n.",

    "content": "Discover how AI agents simplify work and help you reclaim your day — smarter, faster, better.\n\nIt’s 8:15 on a busy Monday morning, and you’re already staring at a mountain of emails, meeting invites, and reports to write. Usually, this would stress you out — but today feels different. Your AI assistant kicks in, picking out the important stuff, and even putting together a draft for that quarterly report you’ve been putting off. While you sip your coffee, the AI is quietly sorting her schedule and gathering info for meetings.\n\nIt’s not perfect — it may get a deadline wrong or ask you for your input — but that’s exactly why it works. The AI handles the repetitive stuff, and you manage the rest. This mix of smart tech and human touch is changing how we work. Discover what exactly are AI agents, how they work, and why they’re becoming an essential part of today’s digital workplace.\n\nWhat is an AI agent?\n\nAI agents are systems that can independently observe a situation, make decisions based on goals and context, and take action — without needing constant human input. They’re designed to go beyond simple automation, combining reasoning, memory, and the ability to interact with other systems or tools to achieve a defined outcome.\n\nUnlike traditional bots or scripts that follow fixed instructions, AI agents are capable of adapting their behaviour based on what’s happening around them. They can plan multi-step tasks, respond to changing conditions, and even decide when to escalate or pause. This makes them especially useful for dynamic, high-context tasks across operations, customer support, internal workflows, and more.\n\nBenefits of AI agents\n\nLet’s break down the core elements behind the scenes — the ones that turn an AI-powered tool into an actual agent capable of working independently:\n\nPerception\n\nAI agents need a way to take in data from their environment. That could be natural language (via text or voice), sensor data, images, clicks, logs, or any other input that gives the agent context. This is where NLP, computer vision or speech recognition often come into play. Perception is what lets the agent “see” or “hear” what’s happening before it decides what to do.\n\nReasoning & decision-making\n\nThis is the core logic. Once the agent understands what’s happening, it needs to figure out what to do next. Some agents rely on rule-based systems or decision trees. Others use more complex methods like reinforcement learning, planning algorithms or probabilistic models to weigh different options, predict outcomes and choose actions that align with goals.\n\nMemory\n\nSmart agents remember. They track previous interactions, learn user preferences, store historical outcomes, and continuously adapt their behaviour over time. Memory can be short-term (session-based) or long-term (user profiles, past decisions). This allows the agent to get better — and more relevant — the more it’s used.\n\nLearning loop\n\nUnlike traditional automation, AI agents improve with experience. They collect data from every interaction, compare outcomes, and adjust future decisions. Learning is a key part of what makes them more than just static systems – through supervised learning, reinforcement learning or fine-tuned LLM\n\nprompts\n\n.\n\nActuation\n\nFinally, the agent needs to act on decisions. That might mean responding to a user, triggering a process, sending an alert, updating a database or coordinating with another system. Actuation can be as simple as a\n\nchatbot\n\nreply or as complex as orchestrating workflows across platforms.\n\nTypes of AI agents\n\nAI agents vary widely in how they operate and what they’re capable of. Some follow fixed instructions, while others learn, adapt, and act with increasing independence. Here are the most common types:\n\nReactive agents\n\nThese are the simplest kind. They don’t have memory or the ability to learn — they just respond to the current input. Think of them as highly efficient responders, useful for repetitive tasks with predictable conditions.\n\nModel-based reflex agents\n\nA step up from reactive agents, these can store information about the world and use it to make better decisions. They maintain a basic internal state, helping them react more accurately in dynamic environments.\n\nGoal-based agents\n\nThese agents evaluate different actions based on desired outcomes. They can plan ahead, weigh trade-offs, and choose the best path toward a defined goal. This makes them ideal for more strategic tasks.\n\nUtility-based agents\n\nWhen there’s more than one way to reach a goal, utility-based agents shine. They not only aim for a result, but also try to\n\nmaximise usefulness\n\n— picking the option with the best expected value. These agents handle complexity and uncertainty well.\n\nLearning agents\n\nThese are the most adaptable. They learn from experience, improve performance over time, and adjust their strategies based on feedback. They’re often used in environments that change or where outcomes can’t always be predicted in advance.\n\nMulti-agent systems\n\nSometimes, the best results come from teamwork. In a multi-agent system, several agents collaborate — or even compete — to achieve broader goals. This setup is common in logistics, simulations, and distributed problem-solving environments.\n\nAI agents, AI assistants, and bots: what’s the difference?\n\nThese terms are often used interchangeably, but they refer to different levels of complexity and capability.\n\nBots\n\nare automated programs designed to perform specific, often simple, repetitive tasks. They can answer basic questions, send messages, or follow predefined commands, but usually lack the ability to adapt or learn from interactions. For example, a website chatbot that only replies to “What are your opening hours?” is a bot.\n\nAI Assistants\n\nare a step up from bots. They use artificial intelligence to better understand user intent and context, allowing them to handle more complex tasks like scheduling meetings, offering personalized suggestions, or guiding users through services. AI assistants improve over time by learning from interactions. Examples include Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant.\n\nAI Agents\n\nare broader and more autonomous systems designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. They often combine several AI capabilities — like natural language processing, planning, and problem-solving — and can operate across multiple domains or tasks without constant human input. AI agents might manage workflows, optimize processes, or handle dynamic situations with minimal supervision.\n\nReal-world applications for AI agents\n\nHere are some practical examples where they deliver real value:\n\nCustomer support\n\nAI agents handle routine inquiries instantly. They help book appointments, answer product queries, and fix common problems anytime, day or night. Over time, they learn what each customer prefers, making conversations smoother and quicker — which keeps customers happier without extra staff.\n\nSmart home automation\n\nThese agents can even learn your habits. They adjust heating, lighting, and security automatically to fit your routine. For example, they can turn off the lights when you leave or warm up the house just before you get home. It’s like having a system that pays attention, so you don’t have to.\n\nSupply chain management\n\nAI agents keep an eye on\n\nstock levels\n\n, predict when demand will rise or fall, and spot issues before they happen. They help businesses order just the right amount, avoid delays, and cut down on waste. This means smoother deliveries, lower costs, and\n\nhappier customers\n\n.\n\nHealthcare assistance\n\nIn\n\nhealthcare\n\n, AI agents collect and analyse data from patient records and wearables to catch warning signs early. They suggest personalised treatments and monitor recovery progress, giving doctors a powerful tool to improve care while letting them focus on patients, not paperwork.\n\nFinancial advisory\n\nAI agents track spending, spot suspicious activity, and offer tailored advice based on market changes and personal goals. They help people manage money smarter and faster, while banks can provide more relevant support without waiting for a human agent to step in.\n\nHow to implement AI agents?\n\nIntroducing AI agents into your workplace needs to be done thoughtfully.\n\n1. Identify key tasks and pain points\n\nStart by pinpointing the repetitive or time-consuming tasks your team faces daily. For example, if your customer service reps spend hours answering common questions, that’s a prime spot for AI. Or maybe the scheduling or data entry processes are slow and prone to errors. Choose tasks where AI can bring clear improvements in speed or accuracy.\n\nTip:\n\nTalk to your frontline teams. They know best what slows them down.\n\n2. Involve your team early\n\nBring in the employees who will use or be affected by the AI agent. Ask what they would find helpful and what worries they might have. If your sales team feels the AI could help by prioritising leads, get their input. This makes the AI more useful and builds trust.\n\nTip:\n\nRun workshops or informal chats to gather honest feedback before building or buying the solution.\n\n3. Start small and pilot\n\nDon’t roll out AI across everything at once. Begin with a simple, well-defined use case, like automating meeting scheduling or answering FAQs on your website. This allows you to see how the AI performs and fix issues early without disrupting the whole business.\n\nTip:\n\nChoose a department or team open to trying new tools and ready to give feedback.\n\n4. Train and fine-tune continuously\n\nUse real user interactions to improve your AI agent’s responses. If it misunderstands customer questions or misses certain details, adjust its training. Over time, it will become more accurate and aligned with your specific needs.\n\nTip:\n\nSet up regular review sessions with your team to assess performance and suggest improvements.\n\n5. Integrate with existing systems\n\nConnect your AI agents to your\n\nCRM\n\n, calendar tools, databases, or other platforms. For example, an AI agent integrated with your CRM can provide sales reps with up-to-date customer info without manual searches.\n\nTip:\n\nInvolve your IT department early to smooth out integration challenges.\n\n6. Maintain human oversight\n\nDefine clear escalation paths so the AI hands off tricky issues to human experts. This keeps customers happy and reduces frustration. For instance, if an AI agent can’t resolve a complaint, it should immediately connect the customer with a human advisor.\n\nTip:\n\nTrain your team to work alongside AI, not against it, seeing it as a helpful assistant.\n\n7. Scale up thoughtfully\n\nOnce your pilot shows positive results, expand your AI agents’ role step by step. Maybe next they handle more complex queries or support additional teams. Always keep measuring how well the AI is performing and how users feel about it.\n\nTip:\n\nAvoid rushing; growth with continuous feedback keeps your AI agents effective and trusted.\n\nAgentforce: powering AI agents the smart way\n\nSalesforce Agentforce is the powerhouse platform that brings AI agents out of isolation and into the heart of your business.

    "content": "Explore how financial institutions are using AI to deliver faster, smarter, and more personalised customer service — starting with simple steps.\n\nA customer gets a payment declined at checkout. Another waits 40 minutes for help on a simple issue. A third is offered a loan that makes no sense.\n\nThese aren’t edge cases — they’re daily pain points across financial services. And most of them are fixable. Teams using AI well are delivering faster support, better recommendations, and experiences that feel personal.\n\nThis guide breaks down how they’re doing it — with clear examples, practical tools, and real use cases you can act on.\n\n1. Conversational AI\n\nAI-powered assistants are now one of the most visible — and expected — applications in\n\ncustomer service\n\n. In financial services, they’re helping institutions stay available to customers 24/7, without compromising on the quality of service. These assistants can handle queries quickly and accurately.\n\nBut there’s more to it than just answering FAQs. The most advanced assistants are built to understand context, learn from past interactions, and adapt their responses to each user. They can handle complex tasks like guiding users through onboarding processes, helping them reset authentication methods, or even flagging suspicious activity. And because they’re\n\nintegrated with internal systems\n\n, they can provide real-time information — like available loan offers or the status of an insurance claim — instantly.\n\nHow to implement:\n\nIntegrate with core systems to provide real-time, personalised responses.\n\nTrain using real support transcripts and common customer queries.\n\nSet clear handover rules for smooth transition to live agents.\n\n2. AI-powered fraud detection\n\nPersonalisation in financial services used to mean addressing customers by name in an email. Today, with the support of AI, it’s about anticipating needs and offering proactive support. When someone’s spending patterns shift, when they’re approaching a credit limit, or when a policy renewal is due — AI can detect it, understand the context, and trigger the right message or support action.\n\nThis kind of real-time intelligence allows your service teams to be far more helpful — and far more relevant. Customers might receive a notification explaining why a transaction was blocked, or a live agent might already know the issue a customer is likely to raise, based on recent activity. This shortens resolution times and builds real trust.\n\nHow to implement:\n\nCombine transaction data with user behaviour to flag anomalies.\n\nTrigger real-time alerts with clear options for user confirmation.\n\nReview false positives often to keep friction low and trust high.\n\n3. Hyper-personalised recommendations\n\nWith AI, it’s now possible to deliver recommendations that go far beyond “people like you also bought.” By analysing behaviour across channels — from spending patterns to searches and financial goals — AI helps you offer products and advice that genuinely fit each customer’s life.\n\nIt’s not about guessing what someone might want. It’s about having enough relevant, real-time insight to help them make better decisions, at the right moment — whether that’s suggesting a savings plan, highlighting a better mortgage offer, or alerting them to something they didn’t know they needed.\n\nHow to implement:\n\nUse AI-ready platforms like Salesforce Financial Services Cloud or create custom models with AWS SageMaker or Azure ML.\n\nEnrich profiles by combining behavioural data from your app, site, CRM, support tickets, and external data sources.\n\nBuild clear and transparent opt-ins for personalisation — especially important to stay\n\nGDPR-compliant\n\nand build trust.\n\nTest different recommendation approaches and track performance to continuously refine the model.\n\n4. Intelligent routing for faster, smarter service\n\nWhen a customer reaches out, they want answers — not transfers, delays, or repetitive questions. AI helps by understanding the nature of each request in real time and routing it to the most appropriate team, system or bot, based on topic, urgency, and past interactions.\n\nDone right, this creates a\n\nsmoother experience for the customer\n\nand a more efficient workflow for your teams. Complex cases go to the right human specialists, simple ones are handled instantly by automation, and everything feels just that bit more seamless.\n\nHow to implement:\n\nTrain the model using your own historical data, including ticket categories, resolution outcomes and average handling time.\n\nContinuously review routing performance, not just by speed but also by customer satisfaction and resolution success.\n\nSet fallback flows to ensure unresolved queries always escalate to a qualified agent when needed.\n\n5. Proactive customer support\n\nInstead of waiting for customers to hit a problem and reach out, AI allows you to step in ahead of time. It could be predicting an overdraft, flagging a declined payment before it causes friction, or noticing unusual activity. AI can trigger personalised, proactive interventions.\n\nThis kind of support changes the relationship. It shows customers you’re paying attention, and that you’re willing to help even when they haven’t asked yet. It builds trust, improves retention, and often reduces support volume too.\n\nHow to implement:\n\nUse predictive analytics platforms like Salesforce Einstein, Pega, or build custom models using Time Series Forecasting.\n\nCreate proactive support playbooks — define which scenarios require outreach and through which channels (SMS, email,\n\nchatbot\n\n, etc.).\n\nSet up automated messages for common scenarios but always offer a clear path to human support.\n\nMonitor which proactive actions are most appreciated and which generate the highest response or resolution rates.\n\n6. Claims automation\n\nIn insurance, claims are a key moment of truth — and speed, clarity, and empathy matter. AI can help fast-track the process by reading documents, checking for inconsistencies, and even flagging possible fraud, reducing the time it takes to process simple claims from days to minutes.\n\nBut automation doesn’t mean cold or impersonal. Done right, it frees up human adjusters to focus on complex cases and gives customers clear, real-time visibility over the progress of their claim — something most insurers still struggle to offer.\n\nHow to implement:\n\nUse document processing tools like AWS Textract, Google Cloud Vision or Tractable to extract and analyse claim data.\n\nSet up thresholds and business rules to allow automatic approval of low-risk, straightforward claims.\n\nOffer a mobile- or web-based interface where customers can upload documents and track claim status in real time.\n\nConnect the system to fraud detection modules to add another layer of security for high-risk cases.\n\n7. Voice biometrics\n\nSecurity questions and passwords are frustrating — especially when a customer is in a rush or needs urgent support. With voice biometrics, AI listens to just a few seconds of speech and confirms identity based on unique vocal patterns, making phone authentication quick, seamless and secure.\n\nThis doesn’t just improve the customer experience. It also reduces fraud, cuts call times, and lifts pressure off support teams who no longer have to follow long authentication scripts.\n\nHow to implement:\n\nIntegrate tools like Nuance Gatekeeper or Amazon Connect Voice ID into your call centre platform.\n\nOnboard users by collecting a short voice sample (often just a few seconds) during a natural conversation or a guided enrolment.\n\nSet thresholds and fallback options to ensure a second layer of verification when needed.\n\nEducate users about how it works and why it’s safe, to encourage adoption and trust.\n\n8. Sentiment analysis\n\nSometimes, a customer’s words, tone or phrasing can reveal frustration long before they threaten to leave. AI can detect those signals — in emails, chats, and call transcripts — helping your team step in before things escalate.\n\nBy identifying moments of tension early, you can reduce churn, improve service recovery, and make your agents feel better equipped to respond with empathy and precision.\n\nHow to implement:\n\nUse NLP tools like IBM Watson, MonkeyLearn or Microsoft Azure Text Analytics to analyse written and spoken language.\n\nTrain models using your own support transcripts or chats to increase contextual accuracy.\n\nTag interactions with sentiment scores and set rules to trigger alerts or escalation workflows when negative signals are detected.\n\nFeed those insights into your customer success platform to help agents personalise follow-up actions.\n\nHow to implement AI in your financial services company\n\nBefore you scale any AI initiative, it’s worth pausing to make sure your approach is grounded, realistic and built for long-term impact.\n\nStart small, iterate fast\n\nFocus on one or two high-volume, low-risk use cases — like automated routing or proactive alerts — and track how well they work before expanding. Set clear success metrics from the start, and be prepared to adjust based on what you learn. A small success with measurable results is worth far more than a broad, vague rollout.\n\nKeep a human in the loop\n\nAI should enhance your customer service, not become a wall between people. Always offer clear, accessible escalation paths to human support — especially when customers feel frustrated or confused. Let your teams step in when nuance, empathy or accountability are needed.\n\nDesign for transparency and control\n\nMake it easy for customers to understand how AI is being used — and to adjust their preferences if they want to. This is especially important when you’re dealing with\n\nsensitive data\n\nor personalised recommendations. The more transparent your AI, the more confident your users will be in the experience.\n\nThink beyond efficiency\n\nAutomation can save time and reduce costs, but its real value comes from enhancing the customer experience. Don’t just focus on what AI can do faster — focus on how it can make interactions smarter, more relevant, and more human. That’s what sets leading financial brands apart.\n\nPartnering for intelligent service\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we help financial services teams move from ideas to real, working AI-powered solutions. We collaborate closely with you to design, build and implement intelligent customer service experiences — with impact, for both your users and your business.\n\nHere’s how we can help:\n\nUncover the right opportunities\n\nby analysing your channels, processes and data flows to identify where AI can deliver real value.\n\nDesign experiences that are clear and helpful\n\n, ensuring that automation actually improves the customer journey — and that users know exactly what’s happening.\n\nBuild and integrate AI solutions\n\nthat connect with your existing platforms — from CRMs and core\n\nbanking systems\n\nto contact centre tools.\n\nWork iteratively and pragmatically\n\n, so you can move fast, launch with confidence, and continuously improve based on real user feedback.\n\nIf you’re ready to make customer service smarter — and not just more automated — we’d love to explore it with you.\n\nGet in touch\n\n!",

    "content": "Understand how Open Banking APIs work, what they enable, and why they’re redefining how financial services are built – securely and at scale.\n\nBanks opening up their data – sounds risky? It’s actually the way to build better services and reach customers in new ways. Businesses can access banking data securely, speed up innovation and enable smarter, more personalised products.\n\nBut behind the headlines and regulations, there’s a lot to unpack. How do these technologies work? What are the real benefits and the challenges? Here’s all you need to know about API and Open Banking.\n\nWhat is Open Banking?\n\nOpen Banking is a shift in how financial information is shared and, more importantly, who controls it. Traditionally, your bank held all your data (account info, transactions, credit history) and kept it to itself. If you wanted to use a budgeting app, apply for a loan elsewhere, or compare financial products, you’d often have to manually share documents or log in to multiple systems. It wasn’t exactly seamless.\n\nOpen Banking changes that. It puts the customer in charge of your own financial data. With your permission, banks can securely share selected information with other apps, platforms or financial services via APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). This opens the door to smarter tools, faster processes and better financial experiences.\n\nLet’s say you’re applying for a loan. Instead of uploading pay slips and bank statements, you just connect your account through an authorised app. Or maybe you want a real-time overview of all your bank accounts, across different banks, in one dashboard. Open Banking makes that possible.\n\nFor individuals, Open Banking means better tools to manage money. For businesses, it means smarter services, faster onboarding, and fewer barriers to financial innovation. For banks, it’s an opportunity to stay relevant by becoming platforms instead of just providers.\n\nHow do Open Banking APIs work?\n\nAPIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, might sound technical, but the concept is simple: they’re just structured ways for different systems to exchange information securely.\n\nIn the context of Open Banking, APIs are how banks share data with approved third-party providers. And crucially, this only happens if the user gives explicit consent. No permission? No access.\n\nHere’s how it works in practice:\n\nYou open a personal finance app and choose to link your bank account. That app doesn’t store your login details or scrape your screen. Instead, it uses the bank’s API to request access to your data. The bank verifies your identity (often through strong customer authentication), confirms your consent, and shares only the data you agreed to. Everything happens in real time, over secure, encrypted connections.\n\nThe beauty of APIs is that they’re consistent. Every provider works with the same rules, formats, and protocols. This standardisation reduces friction, prevents errors, and makes it easier to build reliable, secure services that scale.\n\nWhy Open Banking APIs matter\n\nOpen Banking APIs are valuable because of what they unlock. They enable new business models, shift customer expectations, and push the entire industry forward.\n\n1. They put customers in control\n\nPeople can choose how and where their data is used, rather than being locked into one platform. That means more transparency and more freedom to find services that fit their needs.\n\n2. They fuel innovation\n\nFintechs and startups no longer need to partner directly with banks to build financial tools. With APIs, they can plug in and create everything from smarter savings apps to real-time payment solutions, all without reinventing the wheel.\n\n3. They level the playing field\n\nOpen Banking APIs allow smaller players to compete with bigger institutions by giving them access to the same data and infrastructure. It’s not just the big banks that get to innovate anymore.\n\n4. They push banks to evolve\n\nWith new entrants offering smoother, faster, more\n\npersonalised experiences\n\n, traditional banks are being nudged to modernise: integrating APIs themselves and often becoming service platforms rather than standalone providers.\n\n5. They enable real-time experiences\n\nAPIs make it possible to deliver financial services that feel as fast and seamless as\n\nthe best digital products\n\nout there, such as instant account verification or up-to-date credit checks\n\nWhat can you do with Open Banking APIs?\n\nOnce you connect to Open Banking APIs, you’re unlocking use cases that make financial services faster, smarter, and more relevant. Here are a few concrete examples of what businesses and developers can do:\n\n1. Build real-time financial dashboards\n\nBy accessing up-to-date transaction data, you can create\n\ntools that show users\n\nwhere their money is going, spot patterns in spending, and even forecast future cash flow – all in real time.\n\n2. Automate onboarding and identity checks\n\nInstead of asking users to upload documents or wait days for manual verification, APIs allow instant access to account ownership data, speeding up KYC (Know Your Customer) processes while improving accuracy.\n\n3. Power smarter lending decisions\n\nWith a clearer view of a user’s income and spending habits, credit risk can be assessed more precisely, making it easier to offer personalised credit options without relying on outdated models.\n\n4. Enable seamless, direct payments\n\nAPIs can initiate payments straight from a customer’s bank account, without relying on card networks or extra intermediaries. This means faster settlement, lower costs, and fewer payment failures.\n\n5. Personalise services based on real behaviour\n\nYou can offer customised financial advice, product recommendations, or alerts based on how people actually use their money, not just based on static profiles or assumptions.\n\nHow to keep financial and personal data safe with Open Banking APIs\n\nWhen people hear “data sharing,” their first concern is often privacy. And rightly so. But Open Banking was built with security in mind from the ground up. In fact, it follows some of the strictest data protection standards out there.\n\nHere’s how data stays safe when working with Open Banking APIs:\n\nConsent is everything\n\nNo data is shared unless the user actively authorises it. That consent is granular (you choose exactly what’s shared) and time-limited (you can revoke it at any time).\n\nStrong Customer Authentication (SCA)\n\nAccessing an account through an Open Banking API typically involves two-factor authentication – not just a password, but an additional step like a device confirmation or biometric check. It’s designed to keep access strictly in the hands of the rightful owner.\n\nRegulated players only\n\nThird-party providers must be licensed and regulated (in Europe, by a national financial authority) to even connect via Open Banking. There’s a formal process, ongoing compliance checks, and accountability in case anything goes wrong.\n\nNo credential sharing\n\nBecause APIs are used instead of traditional login forms, you’re never asked to hand over your banking username or password to anyone. This eliminates one of the biggest\n\nsecurity risks\n\nin older financial integrations.\n\nClear audit trails\n\nEvery data request, every\n\naccess token\n\n, and every interaction is logged, making it possible to track activity and detect anomalies quickly.\n\nHow Near Partner supports your open banking journey\n\nOpen Banking and APIs create opportunities, but they also come with technical and strategic challenges. That’s where Near Partner steps in, offering tailored expertise for every player in the ecosystem.\n\nFor companies building Open Banking APIs\n\nCreating robust, secure, and scalable APIs is no small feat. Near Partner can help you in:\n\nDesigning API architectures that fit your business needs and evolving regulations.\n\nEnsuring smooth integration with existing banking systems, reducing disruptions.\n\nImplementing robust security protocols to protect sensitive financial data while enabling authorized access.\n\nSetting up automated testing and monitoring so APIs stay reliable and performant.\n\nProviding ongoing maintenance and rapid adaptation as open banking standards evolve.\n\nFor banks preparing for Open Banking\n\nOpening your data requires rethinking how your data is managed and shared. Near Partner helps banks:\n\nClean and structure data to meet regulatory quality standards.\n\nBuild secure, efficient data pipelines to feed APIs with accurate, up-to-date information.\n\nModernize legacy systems in a way that speeds up open banking readiness without business interruptions.\n\nDevelop governance models that protect customer privacy and give you control over data sharing.\n\nTrain internal teams on API management best practices for ongoing success.\n\nThis approach reduces risk, speeds time-to-market, and positions banks as trusted, agile market players.\n\nFor companies building applications on Open Banking APIs\n\nIf your business relies on open banking APIs to create new services, Near Partner can help by:\n\nMapping out API capabilities and limitations to set achievable project scopes.\n\nDesigning seamless user journeys that leverage real-time financial data effectively.\n\nDeveloping integrations that combine multiple APIs into cohesive, reliable workflows.\n\nOffering flexible, iterative development so your application can evolve with changing APIs and market demands.\n\nProviding monitoring and troubleshooting support to keep your services running smoothly.\n\nUnlock API and Open Banking with Near Partner\n\nYou already know API and Open Banking are here to stay.

    "content": "Discover what industrial forecasting is, why it’s more relevant than ever and how to do it in your company.\n\nA major shipment arrives late. Inventory piles up in one warehouse and runs dry in another. Your team scrambles. Not because they’re unprepared, but because they’re relying on old data in a business that’s moving in real time.\n\nThat tension (between what’s planned and what’s actually happening) is where industrial forecasting comes in. Discover what it is, the main techniques and how to implement.\n\nWhat is industrial forecasting?\n\nIndustrial forecasting is the practice of predicting key production and operational variables – like machine availability, material usage, order volume, and shift capacity – using real-time and historical data. It’s used to anticipate bottlenecks, prevent downtime, optimise inventory, and align production plans with actual demand.\n\nWhy industrial forecasting matters more than ever\n\nWith reliable forecasting, teams can make the most of available resources (people, machines, time) and plan more sustainably, avoiding unnecessary overtime or costly last-minute shifts.\n\nIt gives planners and floor managers real-time insights into what’s coming, so schedules are aligned with actual capacity, not assumptions. It also cuts storage costs and avoids overstock or stockouts. Done right, it can even help spot early signals of change, like a drop in demand, a machine approaching overload, or a shift in supplier delivery rates.\n\nIndustrial forecasting techniques\n\nDifferent operations need different models, depending on the type of data available, how fast things change, and what you’re trying to predict. Below are the main techniques used in industrial environments, along with when and why to use them.\n\n1. Time series analysis\n\nThis is the go-to method when you have historical data and want to identify patterns over time, like seasonality, trends or cycles in production, sales or machine usage.\n\nBest for\n\n:\n\npredicting demand fluctuations, planning maintenance cycles and understanding long-term trends\n\n2. Regression analysis\n\nThis technique looks at the relationship between variables; for example, how temperature, shift length, or supplier lead times might impact output (e.g. “If supplier A is late by 48h, what’s the impact on line 3?”)\n\nBest for:\n\nestimating the impact of specific factors on production and identifying correlations between inputs and outputs\n\n3. Machine learning models\n\nML models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks take in large volumes of structured and unstructured data – especially the one that humans typically miss – and find complex, non-obvious patterns.\n\nBest for:\n\ncomplex environments with lots of variables and dynamic operations with fast-changing data.\n\n4. Simulation models (e.g. Monte Carlo)\n\nThese use probability to simulate thousands of different possible scenarios and outcomes. The model gives you risk-aware insights, such as the probability of missing a delivery deadline if X and Y go wrong.\n\nBest for:\n\nplanning under uncertainty and stress-testing your production plans.\n\nIndustrial forecasting meets AI\n\nToday, AI has stepped into the factory with real, practical impact. It’s changing how operations anticipate demand, manage resources and stay ahead of problems. Here’s how it can help make forescasting easier.\n\nReal-time insights\n\n. AI pulls in live data from your machines, ERP, logistics, suppliers, even weather APIs if needed. The challenge? Many teams realise too late that their data isn’t clean, structured or even accessible enough to train useful models. Messy data in, messy answers out.\n\nPattern spotting\n\n. AI can spot relationships you’d never find manually, like how a temperature drop last winter slowed your output, or how one supplier’s slight delays cascade into missed delivery targets.\n\nMulti scenario analysis.\n\n“What if our top supplier goes offline?” “What if demand spikes next month?” AI lets you play out these questions with data-backed impact predictions.\n\nHuman validation:\n\nAI doesn’t make the final decision. But it gives you the kind of visibility and context that changes how you think. Less lag, more alignment with what’s really going on across your operation.\n\nNatural language queries:\n\nusually, “talking” to your data means developing custom queries or relying on standard reports. That takes time, expertise and is error prone. With AI, forecasters can talk to their stock or sales data, as they would to a human, and get real-time responses.\n\nIndustrial forecasting: how to do it\n\nKnowing the right method is one thing. Making it work in practice, with your people, tools, and processes, is another. Here’s how to implement forecasting in real industrial environments.\n\n1. Identify what needs forecasting\n\nStart by pinpointing the real business questions. Questions can rage from “How much output do we need to meet demand next week?”, “Are we likely to run into a supply delay?” or “Should we ramp up or slow down a specific production line?”\n\n2. Collect real-time data, but only the relevant kind\n\nSet up sensors, connect your ERP, MES, or SCADA systems, and pull in live data that answers those key questions. Focus on high-impact signals: production cycle times, raw material usage, machine availability, customer orders.\n\n3. Clean and structure your data for decision-making\n\nForecasting doesn’t work with messy inputs.\n\nNormalize your data\n\n(units, formats, timestamps), filter out noise, and ensure it reflects the rhythm of your operations.\n\n4. Choose the right model and don’t overthink it\n\nStart simple. There’s no need to dive into machine learning from day one. Moving averages could be simple enough for inventory and throughput. Linear regression can help to link production variables.\n\n5. Integrate the forecasts into your operations\n\nDon’t leave forecasts in a dashboard. Embed them directly into your planning tools or workflows. That could mean auto-adjusting production targets, flagging inventory risks, or triggering supplier orders. Build alerts, planning boards, or simple automated triggers inside tools your teams already use, like Power Apps and Notion with real-time connections.\n\n6. Choose a partner who can make it work\n\nForecasting only becomes useful when it fits your tech, your people and your pace. That’s where the right partner makes all the difference. You need someone who knows how to connect messy industrial data with business logic and build something scalable and fast.\n\nNear Partner has helped\n\nmanufacturing businesses\n\nuse real-time forecasting to reduce waste, optimise resources and finally get ahead of unexpected demand. We’re ready when you are.\n\nIndustrial forecasting challenges (and how to overcome them)\n\nEven great forecasts fail when real-world complexity kicks in. Here are the most common roadblocks and what to do about them.\n\n1. Poor data quality or limited access\n\nYour forecasts are only as good as your inputs — and most factories still run with incomplete, siloed or outdated data.\n\nWhat to do about it:\n\nRun a fast data audit: what’s missing, what’s duplicated, what’s useful? Use APIs or low-code connectors to fill the gaps, without heavy\n\nmigrations\n\n.\n\n2. Slow forecasts\n\nBy the time a report is ready, it’s already out of date and operations have moved on.\n\nWhat to do about it:\n\nshift from static dashboards to live forecasting views. Embed forecasts directly into tools where action happens.\n\n3. Lack of trust\n\nIf the results feel disconnected from reality, no one follows them. Or worse, they override them without context.\n\nWhat to do about it:\n\nMake forecasts transparent and show what data feeds them and how they’re calculated. Involve key users early so models reflect operational logic.\n\n4. Overengineering\n\nIt’s tempting to jump straight into AI and machine learning. But if your basics aren’t solid, these models won’t work or won’t last.\n\nWhat to do about it:\n\nstart with simple models that already drive decisions. Layer in complexity only when the use case proves it.\n\nStreamline your industrial forecasting with Near Partner\n\nReal-time forecasting doesn’t have to be complex. With the right partner, it becomes a practical tool for better decisions, and a real advantage in how you plan, produce and scale.\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we help manufacturing teams turn raw industrial data into clear, actionable forecasts, without long timelines or overcomplicated tech. Let’s make your production smarter, faster and easier to manage.\n\nReach out when you’re ready\n\n.",

    "content": "Looking to save time and money while staying flexible? Low-code development is the answer. See why it’s the investment your business needs.\n\nNo-code and low-code platforms are revolutionizing app development, enabling businesses to achieve in weeks what once took months—or even a year. By\n\nreducing development time by up to 90%\n\n, these solutions empower companies to launch applications faster, adapt to market demands, and stay ahead of the competition, all while optimizing resources and costs.\n\nBut what exactly is low-code, and how can it benefit your business? Discover how this innovative approach can streamline your operations and determine whether it’s the right investment for your company.\n\nWhat is low-code?\n\nThink for a second about whatever IT project you’ve got underway—whether it’s revamping your CRM system or building a new customer portal. How long has it been in development? How many people and departments are involved? Now imagine if you could bring a pilot version of it to market as soon as next week, and improve it week by week, for as long as it was needed. What kind of impact would that have on your business?\n\nThis radical shift in the development mindset—focusing on speed, iteration, and adaptability—is at the very core of low-code. Low-code is a development approach that allows you to build applications with minimal hand-coding. Instead of writing every line of code manually, you use visual tools to create your app, like drag-and-drop interfaces and pre-built components. The idea is to speed up the development process by eliminating much of the complexity of traditional coding.\n\nAlso, it’s designed to make app development accessible to both developers and non-developers alike. For businesses, this means you can quickly build or modify software without complex coding languages. But the advantages don’t stop there.\n\nWhy low-code development is a smart investment\n\nLow-code\n\nis an attractive investment for a number of reasons. Here’s why it’s gaining momentum in boardrooms everywhere.\n\nFlexibility\n\nWith low-code platforms, you can customize applications quickly. You don’t have to worry about rigid software solutions that don’t quite fit your needs. Need to tweak a feature, change the user interface, or\n\nadjust a workflow\n\n? Low-code platforms give you the power to modify applications without needing to rewrite endless lines of code. This means you can build apps that work the way you need them to, and adapt as your business evolves.\n\nSpeed\n\nLow-code development slashes the time it takes to create and deploy apps. For businesses under pressure to innovate or scale quickly, rolling out functional applications in a fraction of the time is invaluable.\n\nCost-effective\n\nHiring a full team of developers to build software from the ground up isn’t cheap. Low-code platforms drastically reduce the need for specialized coding skills and extensive development resources, cutting both development time and costs. For businesses with tight budgets, this is a major win. Plus, you can often find low-code solutions with flexible pricing that can scale with your company’s growth.\n\nLower risk of overcomplication\n\nTraditional software development\n\ncan get bogged down in complexity, leaving you with a solution that’s either over-engineered or missing the mark. With low-code, you can focus on the core functionality you need without over-complicating things. It’s about getting results, not perfection.\n\nLimitations of low-code development\n\nWhile low-code development offers several benefits, it’s not without its drawbacks. Here’s where you need to tread carefully.\n\nLimited customization for complex solutions\n\nWhile low-code is great for quick, basic applications, some coding may be required to deliver highly customized, complex solutions. If you’re building something that requires intricate features or deep\n\nsystem integrations\n\n, you can still use low-code but you’ll likely need an expert set of hands to guide you along the way.\n\nSecurity risks\n\nLow-code platforms often come with built-in\n\nsecurity features\n\n, but that doesn’t mean they’re foolproof. When using low-code, it’s essential to evaluate the security measures of the platform and ensure it aligns with your business’s compliance standards. A breach could cost far more than a traditional development project.\n\nScalability issues\n\nLow-code apps are great for rapid deployment, but as your business grows, the demands on your software might grow as well. While low-code platforms can handle many use cases, they might not be able to scale as efficiently as a fully custom solution would. Be sure to assess whether the platform can handle your long-term growth.\n\nVendor lock-in\n\nLow-code platforms often tie you to a single vendor, making it harder to move your app to a different platform if needed. This could lead to higher costs in the long run, especially if your business outgrows the capabilities of the initial platform.\n\nHow to make low-code development a smart investment\n\nSo, we’ve looked at the pros and cons of low-code development. But how do you make it work for your business? Here’s how to do that from a strategic perspective.\n\nStart with an MVP\n\nDon’t aim for perfection straight out of the gate. Low-code platforms are perfect for creating a minimum viable product (MVP) – a lean version of your app that allows you to test, gather feedback, and iterate quickly. By starting small, you can validate your idea and avoid sinking too much time or money into something that might not work in the long run.\n\nDefine the essential features\n\nKeep it simple. Low-code platforms are great when you focus on the core functionality of your app. Get clear about what your business really needs and avoid feature creep. The simpler, the better – especially when you’re working with a low-code platform that might not have all the bells and whistles of traditional development.\n\nUnderstand platform and ongoing costs\n\nWhile low-code platforms can be cost-effective, don’t forget about the ongoing costs. There’s the subscription fee for the platform, potential fees for adding extra features, and costs associated with maintaining the app as it evolves. Be sure to evaluate the total cost of ownership, including any future upgrades, before making a commitment.\n\nThink long-term\n\nLow-code is a fast way to get started, but you need a long-term plan. Consider the scalability of the platform and whether it will be able to grow with your business. If you foresee needing more complex solutions down the line, you may want to balance your low-code apps with custom-built solutions as part of your global strategy.\n\nInvolve key stakeholders\n\nMake sure everyone’s on the same page. From product managers to business leaders, get input from all the key stakeholders early on in the process. The success of a low-code project relies on having a shared vision of what the app should achieve. Collaboration between the technical and business teams is crucial for avoiding pitfalls.\n\nConsider hiring professional help\n\nIf your in-house team is unfamiliar with low-code, consider partnering with a development team, like\n\nNear Partner\n\n. We can offer additional expertise and help with scaling or overcoming challenges in the development process, ensuring that you’re getting the most out of your low-code platform without losing your edge.\n\nLow-code: the right investment if done right\n\nLow-code development can absolutely be the right choice for businesses that need fast, flexible, and cost-effective solutions. But just like any other technology, it’s not a one-size-fits-all fix. The key to making it a smart investment is aligning it with your business needs, carefully managing its limitations, and planning for the future.\n\nGet in touch\n\nand let us help you explore how low-code can improve your business.",

Here are 7 common mistakes in low-code projects — and how to steer clear of them from day one.\n\nLow-code promises speed, agility, and fewer headaches. But just because it’s\n\nlow-code\n\ndoesn’t mean it’s\n\nlow-effort\n\n.\n\nThen organisations dive into low-code without the right mindset or structure, things can go off track — fast. Apps that were meant to save time become hard to scale or maintain. Tools meant to empower people end up confusing them. So, how do you avoid falling into the usual traps? Let’s unpack the most common mistakes — and what to do instead.\n\nWhat is low-code and why it matters\n\nLow-code is a modern approach to software development that allows applications to be built with minimal hand-coding. Instead of writing every line of code from scratch, developers use visual interfaces, drag-and-drop components, and pre-built logic to accelerate the development process. While it doesn’t replace traditional coding entirely, low-code platforms simplify and speed up the creation of digital solutions — making them ideal for everything from internal tools to customer-facing apps.\n\nFor most companies, low-code is a strategic advantage. It enables faster delivery of solutions, reduces development costs, and allows teams to respond more quickly to client needs — without sacrificing quality. It also opens the door for closer collaboration between technical teams and business stakeholders, as the visual nature of low-code makes it easier to align on goals and iterate quickly.\n\nWhile low-code offers speed and accessibility, it’s not without its limitations. These platforms can be restrictive when it comes to highly customized or complex applications, especially those requiring deep backend integrations, advanced performance tuning, or unique user experiences. There’s also the risk of vendor lock-in, where the business becomes dependent on a specific platform’s ecosystem and limitations. It’s crucial to assess when low-code is the right fit — and when traditional development is the better path — to ensure long-term scalability, security, and flexibility.\n\nDownload eBook “Demystifying Low-Code\n\nCommon mistakes in low-code projects and what to do instead\n\nEven with all its advantages, low-code development isn’t foolproof. Teams can run into issues that slow progress or create technical debt. Here are some common mistakes in low-code projects — and what to do instead.\n\n1. Treating low-code like low-planning\n\nToo often, teams skip essential planning because “we’ll iterate as we go.” But without clear goals,\n\nuser journeys\n\n, or a shared understanding of scope, the project becomes a guessing game. This leads to patchy apps that solve today’s problem but can’t grow with the business.\n\nWhat to do instead:\n\nstart with the same discipline you’d use in any digital project. Do user research, stakeholder alignment, and a roadmap that leaves room for iteration.\n\n2. Building in silos (and hoping for integration later)\n\nIt’s tempting to let each department build their own low-code solutions. After all, that’s the point, right? Empower business users to create apps easily. But isolated tools often mean duplicated logic,\n\ninconsistent data\n\n, and massive headaches when you finally try to connect the dots.\n\nWhat to do instead:\n\nInvolve IT or a central architecture team early — not to control the process, but to create standards, set up governance, and ensure apps don’t become islands.\n\n3. Ignoring governance and security\n\nJust because it’s fast doesn’t mean it’s safe. Low-code platforms often abstract complexity — but they don’t remove responsibility. Data still needs to be protected. Access still needs to be managed.\n\nCompliance\n\nstill needs to be taken seriously.\n\nWhat often happens? Teams roll out apps without a second thought about roles, permissions, backups, or audit trails. Until something breaks. Or worse — leaks.\n\nWhat to do instead:\n\nEnsure the platform integrates with your organization’s security protocols — including data encryption, user authentication, and regular backups. Create audit trails and monitor usage to detect risks early. Work with IT and compliance teams to develop guardrails that balance speed with safety, so innovation doesn’t come at the cost of control.\n\n4. Overcomplicating with custom features too soon\n\nOne of the biggest ironies in low-code projects is that they get bogged down with… complexity. Teams start adding custom scripts or complex logic before they’ve even maxed out the platform’s native capabilities.\n\nThis adds risk and maintenance overhead, and also defeats the whole purpose of low-code in the first place.\n\nWhat to do instead:\n\nBefore writing custom code, ask: can this be solved using built-in features or workflow tweaks? If yes, keep it native. Complexity is easy to add, but hard to take back.\n\n5. Ignoring the people who actually use the app\n\nIt’s easy to get caught up in features and functions. But the real test of any low-code app is this: do the people who use it love it — or dread it? Too many projects are driven by top-down assumptions, without involving the users who’ll rely on the tool daily.\n\nWhat to do instead:\n\nUser feedback should be baked into every stage. Co-create where possible. Test with real users early. And never assume you know better than the person who has to use the thing every hour of every day.\n\n6. Treating low-code like a side project\n\nThis one’s subtle but deadly. Teams often underestimate low-code projects — assuming they’re “small” or “quick” because the tech stack is lighter. That mindset leads to poor resourcing, weak sponsorship, and a general lack of priority.\n\nBut low-code apps often support critical workflows. They deserve attention, strategy, and visibility.\n\nWhat to do instead:\n\ntreat the project like it matters — because if it’s solving a real problem, it does.\n\n7. Skipping the long-term view\n\nLow-code platforms make it quick to launch — but what about month six? Or year two? Many teams focus so much on building fast that they forget about long-term maintenance. Who owns the app? Who updates it when business rules change?\n\nWithout clear ownership and a maintenance plan, your low-code app risks becoming tomorrow’s\n\ntechnical debt\n\n.\n\nWhat to do instead:\n\nbefore launch, assign owners, document logic, and create a handover that doesn’t just drop it into the void.\n\nGo low-code the smart way with Near Partner\n\nOne moment you’re building apps at lightning speed, the next you’re tangled in tech debt, bottlenecks, and a sea of half-finished prototypes.\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we co-create\n\nlow-code solutions\n\nwith you.

However,\n\nonly 0.5% of IT projects are truly ‘successful’\n\n– that means completed within budget, on time, and with the intended benefits.\n\nTimelines stretch. Priorities shift. Deliverables get blurry. Without structure, even the best projects quickly lose direction. That’s why understanding the phases of a software project matters. And that’s exactly what the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is for. It gives the project a clear rhythm: each phase with its own focus, outcomes, and handoffs.\n\nOnce you see a project through the lens of SDLC, everything becomes easier to track. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the actual phases of a software project, why it matters to follow a process, and how to pick the model that fits your reality.\n\nWhat is the Software Development Life Cycle?\n\nThe\n\nSoftware Development Life Cycle (SDLC)\n\nis a structured process used by development teams to design, build, test, and deploy software efficiently and with minimal risk. It provides a clear framework that outlines each phase of the software creation process — from initial planning and requirements gathering to development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. By following a defined cycle, teams can ensure that the final product meets user needs, performs reliably, and stays within scope, time, and budget constraints.\n\nDifferent SDLC models exist — including Waterfall,\n\nAgile\n\n, Spiral, and\n\nDevOps\n\n— each offering its own approach to handling these phases based on the nature and scale of the project. Regardless of the model chosen, the core goal remains the same: to bring structure and predictability to software development, promote collaboration among stakeholders, and reduce the chances of costly rework or project failure.\n\nWhy following a Software Development Life Cycle matters\n\nSkipping structure is the fastest way to burn budget and patience. Here’s what a clear development cycle gets you:\n\n1. Less chaos, more clarity\n\nWhen everyone understands what’s coming next, and why, collaboration improves, and confusion fades. You’re no longer dealing with endless “where are we at?” meetings. Instead, the team can focus on building, with a clear objective and vision, and knows why their work is valuable.\n\n2. Risks don’t sneak up on you\n\nThings will eventually go wrong at some point. But a structured process forces you to spot the red flags early, when they’re still manageable, not when they’ve grown into full-blown problems.\n\n3. Fewer rewrites, better results\n\nWithout proper planning and testing stages, most software ends up being patched over endlessly. Following a process helps teams build with intention, so less time is spent fixing avoidable mistakes or doing rework.\n\n4. Smarter use of budget and brainpower\n\nKnowing what’s needed and when helps avoid duplicated effort, missed details, and pointless features. That means your budget isn’t eaten alive by rework and you provide useful features, respecting priorities and needs.\n\n5. It builds real trust\n\nClients, users, investors – they all care about predictability. A visible, repeatable process shows you know what you’re doing and gives everyone confidence that you’ll deliver what you promised. You can guide them through the process, warn about common pitfalls and identify risks on a timely manner, follow good practices and stay on top of the timeline.\n\n7 phases of a software project\n\nEvery software project has moving parts – people, processes, priorities – and without a clear structure, it’s easy to lose track of what’s really happening and what’s next. Breaking it down into well-defined phases will help you deliver with purpose.\n\n1. Discovery and planning\n\nThis is where you decide whether the project is viable, valuable and technically sound. You’ll need to\n\nalign goals\n\n, understand user needs, and map out the scope.\n\nAt this stage, you’re typically:\n\nIdentifying user problems and business needs, and how your solution can help.\n\nDefining goals, risks, and key success metrics.\n\nGathering initial requirements and defining an initial high-level timeline.\n\nOutlining constraints and dependencies.\n\nIdentifying main stakeholders, like SPOCs, Sponsors and SMEs, align your ways of working and communicating.\n\n2. Requirements and analysis\n\nOnce you have a high-level vision, this is where you dive deeper. You’ll translate business needs into detailed technical and functional requirements, with clear priorities and acceptance criteria.\n\nAt this stage, you’re typically:\n\nWriting user stories or use cases.\n\nPrioritising features and defining scope boundaries.\n\nCollaborating across business and tech to align expectations.\n\n3. Design\n\nNow it’s time to define how things will work, like architecture or user experience. Good design keeps both users and developers in mind, reducing friction later.\n\nAt this stage, you’re typically:\n\nCreating wireframes or interactive prototypes.\n\nPlanning system architecture and data flow.\n\nMaking UX and UI decisions aligned with user goals.\n\n4. Development\n\nThis is the build phase, where code starts to take shape. A good development cycle stays agile, with regular feedback loops, code reviews, and integration across teams.\n\nAt this stage, you’re typically:\n\nWriting and reviewing code in sprints or iterations.\n\nTesting incrementally with working demos and receiving users’ feedback.\n\nKeeping communication open between product, design and development.\n\n💡\n\nPro tip:\n\nAutomate testing and deployment as early as possible — it saves time and reduces friction later.\n\n5. Testing and QA\n\nBefore anything goes live, it needs to be tested.\n\nProper QA\n\nensures that the product works as intended, feels reliable, and can handle real-world use cases.\n\nAt this stage, you’re typically:\n\nRunning functional,\n\nintegration\n\n, performance and security tests.\n\nLogging, triaging and fixing bugs.\n\nInvolving users for beta testing or usability checks.\n\n6. Deployment\n\nThis is when the product goes live — but the work doesn’t stop. A well-prepared deployment includes infrastructure, monitoring, rollback strategies and clear communication plans.\n\nAt this stage, you’re typically:\n\nPreparing production environments.\n\nRunning final tests.\n\nCommunicating rollout to users and stakeholders,\n\nProviding any training and/or giving support during solution adoption.\n\n7. Maintenance and iteration\n\nOnce in the real world, software needs care. Maintenance includes fixing bugs, updating systems and making continuous improvements based on user feedback and analytics.\n\nAt this stage, you’re typically:\n\nMonitoring usage and performance.\n\nFixing issues and shipping improvements.\n\nPlanning future iterations or scaling efforts.\n\nCommon SDLC Models and how to choose\n\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all when it comes to\n\nmanaging projects\n\n. The way you structure your project influences everything from speed to risk to flexibility. Knowing your options helps you pick a model that fits your team, your goals and your context, or even combine models to have an hybrid solution.\n\n1. Waterfall\n\nThe classic, linear model. Each phase flows into the next, with little room for going back.\n\nBest if you:\n\nHave fixed requirements and budget.\n\nWork in a highly regulated industry.\n\nNeed clear documentation and sign-off at every stage.\n\nConsiderations:\n\nLittle room for iteration.\n\nNot ideal for evolving or ambiguous projects.\n\n2. Agile\n\nAn\n\niterative, collaborative approach\n\nthat focuses on small, fast cycles and continuous feedback.\n\nBest if you:\n\nWant flexibility and quick releases.\n\nWork with changing requirements or user needs.\n\nPrioritise user feedback and early value delivery.\n\nConsiderations:\n\nRequires strong collaboration and discipline.\n\nNeeds stakeholder buy-in to work well.\n\n3. Scrum\n\nA popular Agile framework with time-boxed sprints, stand-ups and defined roles (like Product Owner and Scrum Master).\n\nBest if you:\n\nHave a team familiar with Agile.\n\nWant structured iterations and accountability.\n\nNeed transparency and velocity tracking.\n\nConsiderations:\n\nCan feel rigid if over-applied.\n\nRequires team maturity and commitment.\n\n4. Kanban\n\nA visual flow-based system focused on limiting work in progress and delivering continuously.\n\nBest if you:\n\nNeed a flexible, low-overhead system.\n\nWant to visualise bottlenecks and improve flow.\n\nHandle ongoing, unplanned or support work.\n\nConsiderations:\n\nLess structured for long-term planning.\n\nWorks best with a disciplined team.\n\n5. Hybrid Models (Agile + Waterfall, etc.)\n\nMany teams blend elements of multiple models, especially in complex or cross-functional environments.\n\nBest if you:\n\nNeed the predictability of Waterfall but the flexibility of\n\nAgile\n\n.\n\nWork across departments with different rhythms.\n\nWant structure without losing adaptability.\n\nConsiderations:\n\nMust be tailored and agreed upon clearly.\n\nCommunication becomes even more critical.\n\nBringing it all together with Near Partner\n\nFollowing a clear development structure is what keeps projects grounded, focused, and genuinely moving forward. But the reality is: every business, every product, every team works differently. That’s where we can help.\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we work with you through the phases of a software project to find the right rhythm for your reality. You’ll get a clear direction, a collaborative mindset, and the flexibility to adapt as things evolve.\n\nIf you want to build software in a way that feels grounded, transparent and truly aligned with your goals,\n\nlet’s talk\n\n.",

    "content": "should include and how to implement it in your company.\n\nEvery company can\n\nbenefit\n\nfrom a diverse, multicultural team, where people with\n\ndifferent backgrounds\n\n, languages, and cultures work together to innovate and create great products. When it comes to IT systems, however, the opposite is true. The\n\nlack\n\nof diversity is the competitive edge, and a shared “language” goes a long way in creating a productive and seamless workflow. This is what an IT integration strategy is, why having one is important for companies of all sizes, and how to implement it.\n\nWhat is an IT integration strategy?\n\nOn average, small\n\nbusinesses use 22 software applications\n\nfor all kinds of purposes. This number goes up to 788 for large enterprises with more than 50,000 employees. Integrating them is one of the biggest challenges for IT departments. So much so, that by 2024 around 65% of organizations will consider spending on integration capabilities as strategic investments.\n\nIt is easy to see why. As the volume of data increases, companies face new challenges in management, particularly in the way systems transfer information between each other. Think Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and Supply Chain Management (SCM) software. Not to mention data warehouses or data lakes, business intelligence (BI) platforms, and enterprise social networking (ESN) platforms. Sowing together all the information these systems generate is a big challenge, even for savvy IT managers.\n\nWhat is IT integration? Source:\n\nCareIT\n\nAn IT integration strategy is, essentially, a plan for how these different IT systems will be made to work together – in other words, “talk” to each other. This way, when a new order arrives, a warehouse picking list can be automatically updated, and a replenishment order issued without human intervention. And every time a machine breaks down, maintenance schedules can be updated, and spare parts ordered.\n\nDoing so can involve anything from choosing compatible software and hardware to developing custom interfaces between systems, to training staff on how to use the new system. In its essence, an IT integration strategy is a roadmap for how an organization will bring together disparate systems and data sources into a cohesive whole. The strategy should detail the goals of the integration, the specific systems, and data sources to be integrated, the budget and resources available, the methods and technologies to be used, and the timeline for completion.\n\nAn effective IT integration strategy will consider the needs of all stakeholders, including users, IT staff, and senior management. With all these factors in mind, a successful IT integration can bring significant benefits to an organization, including increased efficiency, better data management, and enhanced collaboration. And these are just some of its key advantages.\n\nWhat are the advantages of an IT integration strategy?\n\nImplementing an IT integration strategy has significant benefits for companies of every size, from cost savings to increased security.\n\nCost savings\n\nBy\n\nconsolidating\n\nand standardizing disparate IT systems, an organization can reduce the overall number of systems it needs to\n\nmaintain\n\nand support. This can lead to reduced hardware, software, and support staff costs. In addition, an effective IT integration strategy can help an organization reduce duplicate data storage and processing, which can also lead to cost savings. Finally, it can help an organization improve its overall operational efficiency, which can lead to reduced costs associated with inefficiencies. Manual, repetitive tasks needed to adapt to each system’s needs are eliminated and made less prone to mistakes. Time usually spent on non-value-added tasks is put to better use elsewhere.\n\nImproved end-to-end colab\n\nImplementing an IT integration strategy also brings processes closer and\n\nfacilitates\n\ncollaboration and communication. It brings down silos, streamlines processes, and reduces human error. It provides businesses with an end-to-end performance analysis of vital processes. With integrated processes and systems, from sourcing to delivery, it is possible to get transversal data and set common goals. Contrary to what happens when each team works towards its own goals, the IT integration strategy centralizes communication and process automation between the various departments, which unifies goals and increases productivity.\n\nAdditional security\n\nCrucially, an IT strategy can contribute to improved security. By integrating disparate systems, organizations can reduce the number of potential attack surfaces and make it more difficult for attackers to move laterally within the network. In addition, IT integration can improve visibility into network activity and allow for more effective detection and response to security incidents. By sharing information and coordinating responses across different IT systems, organizations can more effectively defend against cyber threats. Finally, IT integration can help reduce the overall cost of cybersecurity by\n\neliminating\n\nduplicate efforts and improving efficiency.\n\nIT Integration challenges: common obstacles and how to overcome them\n\nIntegrating various IT systems, platforms, and processes is essential to building a robust IT strategy. However, integration projects often come with a unique set of challenges that can stall or derail digital transformation efforts.\n\nLegacy Systems\n\nMany organizations still rely on outdated legacy systems that are not designed to integrate easily with modern cloud-based platforms or APIs. These systems often lack documentation, have limited support, and require expensive custom workarounds.\n\nHow to address it:\n\nConduct a systems audit to evaluate the technical debt.\n\nPrioritize modernization or encapsulation strategies (e.g., using middleware or APIs to extend functionality without full replacement).\n\nLack of Interoperability Between Tools\n\nMultiple business units may use different applications that do not “talk” to each other. This siloed architecture hinders data sharing, increases manual work, and introduces inconsistencies.\n\nHow to address it:\n\nStandardize toolsets across departments where possible.\n\nUse integration platforms or iPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service) solutions to centralize and streamline data flow.\n\nData Quality and Consistency Issues\n\nWhen integrating data from different sources, organizations often encounter incompatible data formats, duplicate entries, or inconsistent standards, which can corrupt reporting and analytics.\n\nHow to address it:\n\nDefine data governance policies before integration begins.\n\nImplement data cleansing and transformation processes.\n\nResistance to Change\n\nIntegration often requires changes in workflows, tools, or responsibilities, which can lead to resistance from employees—especially if the benefits aren’t clear or training is lacking.\n\nHow to address it:\n\nInvolve stakeholders early in the integration planning process.\n\nCommunicate the value of integration clearly and offer hands-on training.\n\nLack of Cross-Department Communication\n\nIntegration projects often span multiple teams—IT, operations, finance, etc. A lack of alignment or shared ownership can cause miscommunications, delays, or failure to meet business goals.\n\nHow to address it:\n\nAssign cross-functional integration teams.\n\nUse collaboration tools and regular syncs to maintain transparency.\n\nSecurity and Compliance Risks\n\nIntegrating multiple systems introduces new security vulnerabilities and may risk violating regulatory standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).\n\nHow to address it:\n\nConduct security assessments during planning.\n\nInvolve compliance officers early and document all integration points.\n\nStep-by-step guide to successful IT integration\n\nWhether you’re merging systems post-acquisition, introducing new tools, or aligning operations across departments, a structured and detailed approach to integration is key. Below is an expanded guide:\n\nAssess your current IT landscape\n\nStart by taking a comprehensive inventory of all systems, applications, and data sources in use across your organization. Map out the data flows, system dependencies, and any manual processes bridging system gaps. This will help you identify integration points, redundancies, and areas with technical debt that could complicate the integration process.\n\nDefine integration objectives and requirements\n\nAlign with business stakeholders to define clear, measurable goals for the integration—such as reducing manual effort, improving data accuracy, or enabling real-time visibility. Document what data needs to be shared between systems, which applications are the “source of truth,” and any regulatory or performance requirements to guide your technical planning.\n\nChoose the right integration approach & architecture\n\nSelect an integration strategy that fits your scale and complexity — options include point-to-point connections for simplicity, middleware or ESB for structured environments, or API-led approaches for flexibility and modularity. Consider whether your integration should be real-time, batch-based, event-driven, or hybrid, and choose technologies like iPaaS platforms, API gateways, or ETL tools accordingly.\n\nDesign data models and workflows\n\nCreate clear data mapping between source and destination systems, including field-level transformations and standardizations (e.g., currency, date formats). Define how records will be matched, how conflicts will be resolved, and whether data should sync one-way or bidirectionally. Establish validation and fallback rules to prevent data corruption or duplication.\n\nBuild and configure integration components\n\nDevelop or configure the actual integration components using APIs, webhooks, connectors, or custom middleware. Set up event triggers or scheduled jobs based on business needs, and ensure that all interfaces are authenticated, logged, and secured. Leverage pre-built integrations were available to reduce complexity and time-to-market.\n\nEnsure data governance and security\n\nApply consistent data governance policies across all integrated systems, including ownership, quality standards, and access controls. Ensure that sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit, and that all endpoints follow best practices for authentication, authorization, and logging. Regularly review compliance with relevant regulations like GDPR or HIPAA.\n\nTest rigorously across scenarios\n\nRun thorough testing across all levels: unit tests for individual components, integration tests for connected systems, and end-to-end functional tests. Simulate different scenarios including edge cases, invalid data, and system failures. Use test environments that mirror production and automate where possible using CI/CD pipelines for consistency.\n\nDeploy in phases\n\nStart by rolling out the integration into a limited pilot group, such as a single department or business unit, to monitor performance, gather feedback, and make necessary adjustments. Once validated, deploy the integration gradually to the rest of the organization in phases to reduce risk and ensure stability.\n\nTrain teams and support change management\n\nProvide clear training and support for all affected teams, including documentation, tutorials, and hands-on sessions. Designate the integration of “champions” within each department to guide peers and establish feedback loops through surveys or meetings to address adoption issues and continuously improve user experience.\n\nMonitor, maintain, and optimize\n\nAfter deployment, implement monitoring tools to track performance, failures, and data sync issues in real-time. Conduct regular health checks, update integrations such as APIs or business needs change, and maintain documentation. Continuously gather metrics like latency, error rates, and uptime to identify optimization opportunities and ensure long-term reliability.\n\nIT integration strategy: 7 best practices\n\nFor digital transformation to be a success, there are several best practices to follow. These are the main ones.\n\nSet clear objectives\n\nThere are a few key performance indicators (KPIs) that are important to consider when developing an IT integration strategy, such as the time and cost to complete the integration process. Another important metric is the number of applications that need to be integrated. This will help determine the complexity of the project and the amount of testing that will be required. Finally, the level of data consistency is also a key metric. This will help determine how much data cleansing will be required and how many data discrepancies can be tolerated.\n\nDefine the scope\n\nDefine which processes and systems will be integrated and prioritized. For instance, if lead management, invoicing and stock management software are frequently used together, then these are likely candidates for integration. Also, critical systems where mistakes or delays can represent significant costs can be prioritized. The same goes for those processes where current “integration” requires hefty human intervention. Set clear criteria for which systems need to be integrated sooner rather than later and set the scope for the IT integration project.\n\nDon’t be afraid to review underlying processes\n\nBefore kicking off any IT integration efforts, confirm whether the underlying process is optimized or needs improvement. Automating wasteful steps is a form of waste that will propagate inefficiencies across the organization. Say your current sign-in process requires more information than it needs or more validation steps than necessary. Passing that information onward will lead to excessive use of data storage and increase development time. Carefully review the processes before setting the IT integration project in motion.\n\nIntegrate comms\n\nScattered communications can thwart even the most well-thought-out IT integration plans. Define which channels are to be used and for which type of information (such as Slack for IMs, emails to summarize the next steps and agreements, and so on). With the right and optimized communication channels, employees will be able to interact, clarify doubts, find solutions together, improve customer service and share information – all in an agile, centralized, effective, and productive way.\n\nMake it flexible\n\nIT integration is an ongoing endeavour that requires flexibility to grow and adapt. Ensure that the IT integration strategy is accessible to all company employees, regardless of their level of familiarity with information technologies. Consider\n\nno-code tools\n\nto democratize integration. In this way, any user will be able to update and create integrations to reduce dependence on specialized and dedicated employees.\n\nBring people together\n\nIT integration projects require different viewpoints from people in different areas of the company. So, if you are working to integrate sales and stock management, representatives from both areas (not just IT) such weight in. In this way, professionals will feel more motivated to act and decide together, identifying breakdowns and seeking solutions that are best for the company.\n\nEvaluate results\n\nThe integration of IT operations makes it possible to obtain\n\nperformance indicators\n\n, which are decisive for monitoring the operational and financial health of the company. So, define which metrics best translate your business goals and follow them up closely and periodically. In this way, it will be possible to identify areas that need improvement and those that are performing well.\n\nNeed some help from an IT integration expert?\n\nIT integration is a path to the future.

    "content": "You’ve added sensors to your devices. Built a mobile app. Even set up a cloud dashboard. But somehow… it’s still not working.\n\nCustomers aren’t using the features. Your team’s drowning in fragmented data. And every update feels like duct-taping legacy systems to modern UX.\n\nThis is the trap of product digitalization done halfway. Real transformation means more than adding software — it means rethinking how hardware, data, and digital experiences work together from day one.\n\nWhether you’re scaling hardware, transitioning legacy systems, or turning physical products into data-rich platforms, doing it\n\nright\n\nis what sets competitive teams apart from the rest.\n\nThis guide breaks down the real challenges, the smart shortcuts, and what it takes to digitize products in a way that’s scalable, connected, and built for the future.\n\nWhat is product digitalization?\n\nProduct digitalization is turning traditional products into connected, intelligent, data-generating systems. The goal is not just to make it “smart”, but to continuously collect data, push improvements, unlock services, and adapt to how people actually use it.\n\nThis involves cloud-connected features, control interfaces, and real-time product analytics. It means making it part of a bigger digital ecosystem, one that feeds strategy, operations, and innovation.\n\nAnd despite what many assume, product digitalization goes far beyond IoT devices. It’s already embedded in\n\nindustrial equipment\n\n,\n\nconsumer goods\n\n,\n\nfinancial services\n\n, and other sectors.\n\nBenefits of product digitalization\n\nImplementing organization-wide digitalization (using cloud applications and a tailored portfolio of digital tools) can boost EBIT\n\nby 5 to 8 percentage points\n\n. The gains come from automations, better data usage, and freeing up teams to focus on continuous improvement and product innovation.\n\nFaster development\n\nDigitalizing your product helps you iterate faster, test more efficiently, and push updates without lengthy production cycles. The result? Speed without chaos and a clear path to relevance in fast-moving markets.\n\nSmarter decisions\n\nDigital products generate better, more\n\ngranular data\n\nabout usage patterns or performance metrics. That means your teams stop working on gut feeling and start evolving the product based on what actually works.\n\nNew business models\n\nWant to move beyond one-time sales? Digitalization opens the door to flexible models: subscriptions, usage-based pricing, feature unlocks – or even completely new service offerings.\n\nScalability built-in\n\nA digital product doesn’t hit a ceiling the way physical-only ones do. It’s easier to\n\nintegrate\n\nwith other platforms, localize for new markets, and expand functionality as you grow.\n\nHow to make product digitalization work\n\nProduct digitalization sounds promising (and it is), but it’s also easy to fall into the trap of endless experimentation with no real outcome. Here’s how to keep things grounded.\n\n1. Start with high-friction areas\n\nDon’t fall for tech-first approach. Look instead at what’s slowing you down today:\n\nIs your product’s performance invisible after it leaves the factory?\n\nAre customers calling for support you could’ve prevented?\n\nIs your sales team losing deals because buyers can’t test or simulate use?\n\nPick the top pain point. That’s your entry point, and not a 12-month roadmap. Start where friction is loudest, then work backwards to find the best digital lever.\n\n2. Redesign your product’s value chain with data in mind\n\nMap the full product lifecycle: from design, to usage, to maintenance, to disposal, and ask:\n\nWhere do we lose insight?\n\nWhere do we rely on assumptions?\n\nWhere could\n\nautomation\n\nor feedback loops add clarity or speed?\n\nDigitalization must imply enhanced visibility. Build digital touchpoints where your teams (or clients) are currently flying blind.\n\n3. Build the right foundation: modular, connected, and scalable\n\nThis is where things often stall. If you’re reinventing everything from scratch, it’ll take forever. Instead:\n\nAdopt a\n\nmodular architecture\n\nthat lets you test fast and scale later.\n\nUse APIs to connect digital features with\n\nlegacy systems\n\n(no need to rip and replace).\n\nChoose a cloud infrastructure that supports real-time data flows and cross-device sync.\n\n4. Design for usable data, not just more data\n\nTelemetry is only valuable if it feeds better decisions. So:\n\nIdentify the\n\nKPIs that matter\n\n(downtime, usage patterns, service intervals, client churn…).\n\nBuild your product to capture those metrics in structured, business-relevant ways.\n\nFeed this data directly into systems your teams already use (such as ERP, CRM or\n\nBI tools\n\n).\n\n5. Create space for iteration from day one\n\nAvoid the trap of building a digital product as if it’s a static deliverable. Instead:\n\nShip MVPs that solve one sharp problem, fast.\n\nGet client feedback early, especially from those managing, using or maintaining the product.\n\nBuild in the logic to update or extend your product over time (e.g., OTA updates, feature toggles, user-level analytics).\n\nOff-the-shelf vs custom-built: which path to product digitalization?\n\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all when it comes to product digitalization, and that’s exactly the point. Whatever choice you make, it should depend on one thing:\n\nwhat will get you further, faster, without locking you in\n\n. Here’s how to think it through.\n\nWhen off-the-shelf makes sense\n\nOff-the-shelf (OTS) platforms (like device management dashboards, customer-facing portals, digital twin engines) can be a smart move when:\n\nSpeed matters more than uniqueness.\n\nIf you’re looking to validate a concept quickly, or get something live in 6–8 weeks, OTS tools can be your shortcut.\n\nYou’re solving a common problem.\n\nFeatures like remote monitoring, predictive maintenance, or standard integrations (e.g., SAP, Salesforce) are often better handled by mature third-party tools. They are already tested, updated, and secure.\n\nYou have limited tech capacity.\n\nIf your team isn’t ready to maintain a custom stack, or you want to avoid building internal complexity early on, go OTS and focus your energy on client experience and business outcomes.\n\nKeep in mind that most off-the-shelf tools will require adaptation, especially around branding, workflows or data structures. And beware of vendor lock-in: check exportability, custom API access, and contract flexibility.\n\nWhen custom-built is the smarter investment\n\nCustom-built platforms\n\nare worth the effort when:\n\nYour product requires unique digital logic.\n\nIf your business logic, client workflows, or product interactions are highly specific, trying to bend an OTS tool to fit will cost more than building from scratch.\n\nYou want full control over data and IP.\n\nData is your competitive edge. If the way you collect, structure, and act on it is core to your strategy, go custom. You’ll avoid compromises later.\n\nYou’re building a long-term ecosystem.\n\nPlanning to layer on AI, integrate across verticals, or enable third-party development? A tailored architecture will let you evolve faster, on your own terms.\n\nConsider starting with core modules that are off-the-shelf and custom-building only where differentiation matters most. It keeps speed without sacrificing ambition.\n\nEmbracing product digitalization with Near Partner\n\nOne of the main takeaways from the above is that product digitalization is a long-term strategic move. But to make it work, you need more than a pile of tools. You need a partner who gets the big picture and the nitty-gritty, right from the start and all the way through.\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we build systems that understand your product, your users, and your ambition. You can benefit from our tailored expertise across key areas:\n\nLow-code development\n\n: Rapidly prototype digital features or integrations without the typical coding delay.

    "content": "Even the most well-intentioned initiatives can backfire without a proper change management process. Here’s how to do it well.\n\nChange management can go spectacularly wrong. Kodak once famously failed to transition to digital photography despite inventing the technology. Blockbuster ignored the rise of streaming services like Netflix and declined a purchase offer and Nokia underestimated the smartphone revolution.\n\nWhile it is easy to discard these as obvious mistakes, they were made by thoughtful, well informed (and highly paid) executives. What went wrong? And more importantly, why do\n\n70% of all change initiatives fail\n\n, in companies of all sizes, in small and big projects alike? Here’s what change management actually means and how to do it right.\n\nWhat is change management\n\nChange management isn’t just about implementing new strategies – it’s a deliberate and systematic approach to steering your company through transitions, whether it’s sharing a vision, adopting new technologies, restructuring teams, or adapting to market shifts.\n\nThe key components include:\n\nVision and Strategy:\n\nIt’s important to paint a vivid picture of where your company is headed and why. This vision acts as a beacon, aligning everyone – from the C-suite to frontline employees – towards a common destination. When everyone understands the why behind the change, they’re more likely to commit wholeheartedly and steer in the same direction.\n\nLeadership and Sponsorship:\n\nStrong leadership to champion the change and secure executive buy-in. Involving stakeholders early in the process builds buy-in and reduces resistance. After all, change affects everyone and it’s meant to be a team sport.\n\nPlanning and Shared Roadmaps:\n\nChange doesn’t happen by chance – it requires thoughtful, deliberate planning. A well-crafted plan lays out the steps, timelines, and key milestones needed to guide the organization through transition. But planning shouldn’t happen behind closed doors.\n\nSharing the roadmap with everyone in the company builds trust and transparency. It helps teams anticipate what’s coming, align their efforts, and feel involved in the journey rather than blindsided by it. When people can see the path ahead and understand their role in it, change feels less like a disruption and more like a collective mission.\n\nCommunication\n\nit’s more than sending out memos or holding town hall meetings. It’s about creating a dialogue that fosters understanding and trust. Transparent communication ensures that every team member knows what’s happening, why it matters, and how they fit into the bigger picture. It’s like laying down stepping stones on a path, ensuring everyone knows where to step next and feels confident moving forward together.\n\nTraining and Support:\n\nProviding necessary training and resources to ensure everyone can adapt to new processes or technologies.\n\nMonitoring and Feedback:\n\nRegularly assessing the progress and making adjustments as needed.\n\n10 steps to implement change management\n\nBased on our experience, here are 7 practical tips to ensure a smooth transition:\n\nCreate a sense of urgency\n\nChange is rarely easy but presenting it as urgent and essential can make a significant difference in how your team perceives and embraces it. Urgency creates momentum and focuses everyone’s attention on why the change matters right now.\n\nWhen people understand that the change isn’t just a nice-to-have but a critical step forward, they’re more likely to support it. So, paint a picture of how the future state will be better than the current one. For example, if implementing a new software system, emphasize how it will streamline operations and reduce time spent on repetitive tasks, freeing up resources for more strategic initiatives.\n\nBesides, illustrating what happens if the organization doesn’t change can be a powerful motivator. Discuss market trends, competitive pressures, or customer expectations that necessitate the change. This helps team members understand the risks of maintaining the status quo and reinforces the need for timely action.\n\nRoll out changes in phases\n\nRome wasn’t built in a day, and even if they tried, it would result in chaos. Similarly, managing change can be overwhelming if you try to implement everything at once. Breaking down your initiative into smaller, sequential and manageable phases reduces stress and increases the likelihood of success.\n\nFor instance, if you’re introducing a new CRM system, your phases might include planning and analysis, pilot testing, full deployment to a select group, and finally, company-wide rollout. And before rolling out changes broadly, conduct a beta test with a small group or department. This initial phase allows you to gather feedback, identify potential issues, and refine your approach. It serves as a controlled environment to test the waters and ensure that any unforeseen challenges are addressed early on.\n\nOnce you’ve ironed out the kinks in the beta phase, gradually expand the change to larger groups or departments. This incremental approach minimizes disruptions and gives your team time to adapt without feeling overwhelmed. It also builds confidence in the new processes or systems as success stories emerge from early adopters.\n\nSet goals and KPIs for the change\n\nSetting clear goals and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) is paramount to provide direction and help measure progress along the way. They define what success looks like for your change initiative and allow you to gauge whether you’re achieving the desired outcomes.\n\nGoals should be specific and measurable – such as adoption rates of new processes or systems, employee satisfaction scores, cost savings achieved, or time-to-market for new products or services. Choose KPIs that are meaningful to your organization’s success and can be tracked consistently over time.\n\nDon’t forget to share it with everyone. Visual aids such as dashboards, progress reports, or regular updates during team meetings can effectively communicate the impact of the change initiative and reinforce its importance.\n\nInvest in change management tools\n\nChange management tools help organizations implement change effectively – they support everything from planning and execution to communication, training, and tracking progress. Investing in the right tools ensures everyone has the resources they need to overcome obstacles and move forward confidently.\n\nThis tip is especially useful for large-scale change initiatives, where complexity, volume of stakeholders, and long timelines demand structured, scalable support. For smaller projects, simpler approaches might be enough – but when you’re leading a major transformation across multiple teams or departments, tools can make or break the process.\n\nAlternatively, you can go custom. A tailor-made collaboration tool might include integrated messaging, video conferencing, document sharing, and virtual workspaces – perfect for distributed teams or hybrid environments. These tools help break down silos, centralize updates, and keep everyone in sync throughout the journey.\n\nAddress resistance head-on\n\nResistance to change is natural and can stem from various concerns such as fear of the unknown, scepticism about the benefits, or apprehension about how the change will impact individual roles and responsibilities.\n\nAnticipate resistance and address it proactively. Start by identifying and understanding the reasons behind resistance. This requires listening actively to concerns raised by team members and stakeholders. Are there misconceptions about the change? Are there fears about job security or increased workload? Understanding these underlying issues allows you to tailor your approach accordingly.\n\nEmpower change leaders\n\nChange leaders are influential individuals who champion the change initiative, inspire others, and drive momentum throughout the organization. They act as ambassadors, advocating for the benefits of the change and motivating their peers to embrace new ways of working.\n\nIdentify potential change leaders based on their credibility, influence, and commitment to organizational goals. Look for the ones who are respected across different departments and levels of the organization. Effective change leaders possess strong communication skills, empathy, and a proactive approach to problem-solving.\n\nSeek feedback\n\nFeedback is a powerful tool in the change management toolkit. It serves as a pulse check that provides real-time information on what’s working well, areas needing improvement, and any unintended consequences of the change initiative.\n\nEstablish multiple channels for gathering feedback, like surveys, focus groups, town hall meetings, suggestion boxes, or one-on-one interviews. Promote a culture of open communication where employees feel safe and encouraged to share their honest opinions and experiences. Also, use technology to facilitate anonymous feedback if confidentiality is a concern.\n\nRemove obstacles\n\nEven with a solid strategy and a motivated team, change can stall if roadblocks get in the way. That’s why a crucial part of successful change management is identifying and removing these barriers — whether they’re obvious or more subtle.\n\nCommon obstacles include:\n\nLegacy processes that no longer make sense but are still followed simply because “that’s how we’ve always done it.”\n\nLack of training or resources to properly adopt the new way of working.\n\nResistance from key individuals, often driven by fear, misinformation, or disagreement.\n\nOutdated internal rules or policies that discourage the new approach.\n\nOld technologies that don’t support the new systems or workflows.\n\nBy actively tackling these blockers, you make it easier for your team to move forward with confidence and actually live the change — not just comply with it.\n\nCelebrate short-term wins\n\nChange can feel overwhelming when the finish line seems far away. That’s why celebrating small, early successes is so important. These short-term wins keep morale high, build confidence, and show that progress is real — not just theoretical.\n\nLook for quick wins you can spotlight. Maybe a new system saves the team a few hours a week, or maybe one department hits a key milestone ahead of schedule. Share those stories. Recognize the people involved.\n\nWhen people see tangible results, they’re more likely to stay engaged and motivated for the long haul.\n\nAnchor change in company culture\n\nIf you want change to last, it can’t just be a temporary project — it has to become “the way we do things around here.” This means embedding the new behaviors, processes, and mindset into your company culture.\n\nTalk about the change in onboarding. Celebrate it in performance reviews. Reinforce it in leadership actions. The more the new way of working becomes part of everyday habits and decision-making, the more likely it is to stick.\n\nTrue change doesn’t happen overnight — it’s when people stop thinking of it as new and start seeing it as normal. That’s when you know it’s anchored.\n\nPopular change management models\n\nChange management models are structured frameworks designed to guide organizations through the complexities of change. While these models do not offer rigid step-by-step instructions, they provide a structured approach to managing change effectively.\n\nBefore selecting a change management model, it’s essential to consider the nature of the change you want to implement. For instance, changes that predominantly involve people and organizational culture may benefit from emotion-based models, while changes that emphasize process improvements or system implementations may find value in models that are outcome-oriented. Let’s take a peek to the most popular ones.\n\n1. Kübler-Ross Change Curve\n\nBest suited for\n\n: People-centric changes, particularly those that involve significant emotional adjustments such as organizational restructuring, mergers, or cultural shifts.\n\nThe Kübler-Ross Change Curve, named after psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, outlines the emotional stages individuals typically experience when faced with significant change or loss. Originally developed to explain the stages of grief, this model has been adapted for organizational change management to help leaders understand and address the emotional responses of individuals during times of transition.\n\nThe model identifies five stages that individuals may go through when confronted with change:\n\n[Source:\n\nWhatfix\n\n]\n\nShock and denial\n\n. Initially, individuals may feel disbelief or denial about the change. They may resist acknowledging the reality of the situation.\n\nAnger\n\n. As the reality of the change sets in, individuals may become frustrated or angry. They may express resentment towards the change or those perceived to have caused it.\n\nBargaining\n\n. In this stage, individuals may attempt to negotiate or find ways to avoid the change. They may seek compromises or alternative solutions.\n\nDepression\n\n. Feelings of sadness, helplessness, or anxiety may arise as individuals come to terms with the implications of the change.\n\nAcceptance\n\n. Finally, individuals begin to accept the change and adapt to the new reality. They may start to see opportunities or positives associated with the change.\n\n2. Kotter’s 8-Step Change Model\n\nWhen it comes to managing change in a way that actually works, John Kotter’s 8-Step Model is a go-to framework. It breaks down the process into clear, actionable steps that help organizations move from “this needs to change” to “this is how we do things now.” What makes it powerful is how it blends strategy with the human side of change.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the 8 steps and how they work:\n\nCreate a sense of urgency\n\nBefore anything else, people need to\n\nfeel\n\nthat change is necessary. This means showing real data, telling compelling stories, and highlighting risks of not changing. The goal is to get people saying, “We need to do something – and fast.”\n\nBuild a guiding coalition\n\nChange is a team effort. You need a group of influential people across different levels and departments who believe in the change and can help drive it forward.\n\nForm a strategic vision and initiatives\n\nWhat does success look like? Define a clear vision and outline the initiatives that will help get you there. This gives everyone direction and a shared goal to work towards.\n\nEnlist a volunteer army\n\nYou can’t do it alone. Communicate the vision in a way that gets others excited. The more people onboard early, the stronger the momentum.\n\nEnable action by removing barriers\n\nIdentify what’s slowing people down – outdated processes, fear, lack of resources – and work to eliminate those blockers. Make it easy for people to take the right steps.\n\nGenerate short-term wins\n\nDon’t wait for the big result. Celebrate quick wins along the way to keep morale high and show that progress is happening. These wins help build credibility for the change.\n\nSustain acceleration\n\nKeep the energy up. Use the momentum from early wins to push through tougher challenges. Keep introducing improvements and don’t let the initiative lose steam.\n\nInstitute change\n\nFinally, anchor the new ways of working into your culture. That means reinforcing behaviors, updating training, recognizing new habits, and ensuring leadership continues to support the change long-term.\n\nKotter’s model is popular because it doesn’t just focus on plans and processes – it’s about people, communication, and culture. It helps you not only\n\nstart\n\nthe change, but actually\n\nstick with it\n\nuntil it becomes the new normal.\n\n3. ADKAR Model\n\nBest suited for\n\n: Changes that focus on achieving specific outcomes through individual and team behaviour modifications, such as implementing new software solutions, workflow improvements, or performance optimization projects.\n\nThe ADKAR model, developed by Prosci, is a framework used for understanding the individual elements required for successful change. The acronym stands for the five sequential stages that individuals typically go through:\n\n[Source:\n\nVisual Paradigm\n\n]\n\nAwareness\n\n. The first stage involves creating awareness among individuals about the need for change. It helps them understand why the change is necessary, what the implications are, and how it aligns with organizational goals.\n\nDesire\n\n. Once individuals are aware of the change, they must develop a desire or motivation to support and participate in the change process. This stage focuses on addressing concerns, building commitment, and highlighting the benefits of the change.\n\nKnowledge\n\n. The knowledge stage involves providing people with the information, skills, and resources necessary to implement the change successfully. It includes training, workshops, and access to relevant documentation or tools.\n\nAbility\n\n. After acquiring knowledge, individuals need to demonstrate the ability to implement the change in their daily work or tasks. This stage focuses on practicing new behaviours, applying new skills, and overcoming initial challenges or obstacles.\n\nReinforcement\n\n. The final stage of the ADKAR model involves reinforcing the change to ensure it becomes a permanent part of the organizational culture. It includes celebrating successes, providing ongoing support, and recognizing those who embrace and sustain the change.\n\n4. McKinsey 7-S Framework\n\nBest suited for:\n\nAddressing changes like mergers and acquisitions, organizational redesigns, cultural transformations, or strategic reorientations.\n\nThe McKinsey 7-S Framework was developed by Tom Peters and Robert Waterman at McKinsey & Company in the 1980s. The framework identifies seven interdependent factors that collectively shape an organization’s ability to achieve its objectives and maintain competitiveness.\n\n[Source:\n\nEdrawmind\n\n]\n\nStrategy\n\n. This refers to the organization’s plan for achieving its objectives and goals. It includes the strategic choices made regarding markets, products, services, and competitive positioning.\n\nStructure\n\n. It defines the organizational hierarchy, reporting relationships, and division of responsibilities. It determines how tasks are divided, coordinated, and controlled within the organization.\n\nSystems\n\n. Encompass the formal processes, procedures, and routines that govern how work is done within the organization. This includes information systems, performance management systems, and decision-making processes.\n\nShared values\n\n. Represent the core beliefs, attitudes, and norms that guide behaviour and decision-making within the organization. They define the organization’s culture and shape its identity.\n\nSkills\n\n. It refers to the capabilities, competencies, and expertise of employees at all levels of the organization. They include technical skills, knowledge, and specialized abilities required to perform specific tasks.\n\nStyle\n\n. Draws leadership and management style prevalent within the organization, including behaviours, values, and attitudes demonstrated by top management and influential leaders.\n\nStaff\n\n. Represent the human resources and talent within the organization, including the size, composition, and competencies of the workforce. It focuses on aligning the right people with the right roles to achieve organizational objectives\n\n5. Can You Combine Different Change Models? Absolutely.\n\nWhile each change management model brings its own strengths to the table, the truth is:\n\nthere’s no one-size-fits-all\n\n. The most successful organizations often create a\n\nhybrid approach\n\nthat pulls the best elements from multiple frameworks. Why? Because change is complex. People are different. And each project has its own unique challenges.\n\nHere’s why mixing models might actually work better:\n\nDifferent needs, different tools\n\nSome changes are heavy on processes (like tech implementations), others are deeply emotional (like cultural shifts or restructuring). One model might not cover all the angles – so blending models lets you cover more ground.\n\nKeep it people-centered\n\nFor example, you might use Kotter’s model to drive momentum and structure your change journey, while incorporating the ADKAR model to focus on individual employee experiences. That way, you’re not just checking boxes – you’re actually supporting people through the change.\n\nStay flexible\n\nA hybrid approach gives you more flexibility. You’re not stuck following a linear path if that doesn’t fit your reality. You can adapt to what’s working, drop what isn’t, and stay responsive to feedback.\n\nReal-life example?\n\nImagine you’re rolling out a new digital platform across multiple teams:\n\nuse\n\nKotter\n\nto build urgency, leadership coalitions, and generate short-term wins.Layer in\n\nADKAR\n\nto ensure each individual understands the change, wants to engage, and has the knowledge and support to succeed.\n\nIn the end, change is about people. Whether you’re restructuring, digitizing, or reinventing your business, the goal isn’t just to implement change – it’s to make it stick in a way that’s meaningful and sustainable.\n\nSo don’t be afraid to mix and match. What matters most is finding a path that works for your organization and keeps your people engaged every step of the way.\n\nEmbrace change with Near Partner\n\nChange is a continuous journey of adaptation and evolution.

    "content": "AI has the potential to make supply chain management more efficient – or extremely more complex if not used correctly.\n\nOn the one hand, it can help in managing inventory, placing orders and even in predicting future demand trends, making the job of (human) Supply Chain Managers a lot easier. Bur as AI systems grow an can become overly complicated, they can lead to inefficiencies of their own. Therefore, expert oversight is essential to ensure that AI solutions are streamlined, manageable, and truly beneficial to your supply chain operations.\n\nHere’s what AI means for supply chain management and how to get it right.\n\nWhat does AI mean for supply chain management\n\nTraditional supply chain management relies heavily on human input and manual processes, which can be slow and error-prone. AI, on the other hand, uses machine learning algorithms to analyse data, recognize patterns, make predictions, and automate decision-making processes. This means that AI can help you foresee demand fluctuations, optimize logistics, and even manage your inventory more efficiently. It adds speed, accuracy, and scalability.\n\nBenefits of AI for supply chain management\n\nAI can help supply chain managers in a number of ways. First, it can be used to forecast demand with a higher degree of accuracy by taking in past sales data, market trends, and even social media chatter. With more data, comes a better change at precision.\n\nGoing into more practical matters, AI can automate routine tasks such as order processing, inventory management, and shipment tracking. This not only frees up your team to focus on more strategic activities but also reduces the chances of human error. By saving time, optimizing routes, schedules, and inventory levels, AI can help you cut down on costs.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest benefit for supply chain managers is AI’s ability to detect and alert about unplanned events without relying on predefined rules. This capability allows AI to identify anomalies and potential issues in real-time, offering a proactive approach to problem-solving. Consequently, supply chain managers can respond more swiftly and effectively to unexpected disruptions, ensuring smoother operations and reducing the risk of significant delays or losses.\n\nBig supply chain decisions can also benefit from AI. Whether it’s choosing suppliers, setting prices, preparing production schedules or planning your next move, AI can optimize the analysis and provide unique insights humans might miss.\n\nLimitations of AI for supply chain management\n\nThe main problem companies face when trying to implement AI into their supply chain management is data quality. If your data is messy, incomplete or siloed across different systems, the results won’t be reliable.\n\nAlso, getting started with AI can be expensive. There’s the cost of the tech itself and the training needed to use it. AI systems can also be pretty complicated – to set up and to maintain. If you don’t have in-house expertise, you might need some outside help to get things up and running.\n\nMore data and more connectivity can mean more vulnerability, especially when processing vast amounts of sensitive data. Make sure you’ve got strong cybersecurity measures in place to keep your data safe.\n\nPractical applications of AI in supply chain management\n\nThese are some practical, real-world applications of AI in supply chain management.\n\nDemand forecasting\n\nAI-driven tools can look at past sales, market trends, and even social media buzz to forecast demand. For instance,\n\nSalesforce, with its Einstein Analytics\n\n, uses machine learning to analyse historical data and predict future demand accurately.\n\nExample\n\n: Unilever implemented Salesforce’s Einstein Analytics to enhance its demand forecasting capabilities. By analyzing historical sales data and market trends, Unilever improved its inventory management and reduced instances of overstock and stockouts. The AI-driven insights helped Unilever to anticipate demand fluctuations and adjust production schedules accordingly. Unilever utilized Salesforce Einstein Analytics for predictive demand forecasting, which led to better supply chain visibility and inventory optimization, significantly cutting down costs associated with overstock and stockouts.\n\nAI in Demand Sensing\n\nAI can enhance demand sensing capabilities by integrating real-time data from multiple sources, such as social media, weather forecasts, and economic indicators.\n\nExample\n\n: Procter & Gamble (P&G) employs AI for demand sensing, using machine learning algorithms to analyse diverse data sets and improve demand planning accuracy. P&G employs machine learning algorithms to enhance demand sensing capabilities. They integrate real-time data from multiple sources such as social media, weather forecasts, and economic indicators to improve demand planning accuracy. Procter & Gamble uses AI to analyse diverse data sets for better demand forecasting, improving their supply chain responsiveness and inventory management​.\n\nPredictive Maintenance\n\nAI-powered predictive maintenance systems can forecast equipment failures before they occur, ensuring timely repairs and minimizing downtime.\n\nExample\n\n: General Electric’s Predix platform monitors industrial equipment and optimizes maintenance schedules, enhancing operational efficiency. GE’s Predix platform leverages industrial IoT (IIoT) and AI to predict equipment failures. Predix utilizes advanced analytics and machine learning models to monitor and analyze data from industrial machines. GE’s Predix platform is used to monitor industrial equipment, predict maintenance needs, and optimize repair schedules, which helps in reducing downtime and maintaining operational efficiency\n\nInventory management\n\nToo much inventory ties up cash, and too little means unhappy customers. AI can automate tracking and reordering, so you always have just the right amount of stock. Salesforce’s inventory management solutions integrate AI to provide real-time insights into inventory levels and automate replenishment processes. It can even highlight slow-moving items, so you can run promotions to clear them out. This means you never run out of stock, and you don’t end up with excess inventory taking up space and tying up resources.\n\nExample\n\n: Using Salesforce’s AI-driven inventory management, companies can maintain optimal stock levels, automate reordering processes, and ensure they never run out of stock while avoiding excess inventory\n\nRoute optimization\n\nBy analysing data from various sources, AI finds the most efficient routes and schedules. This means faster deliveries, lower fuel costs, and happier customers.\n\nExample\n\n: A distribution company struggling with inefficient logistics, causing delays and high costs can adopt Salesforce Service Cloud with Einstein AI to optimize logistics and customer service. AI can analyze identify bottlenecks and predict delays. Faster and more reliable deliveries improves customer satisfaction while keeping down costs.\n\nSupplier management\n\nAI helps you evaluate their performance by looking at delivery times, quality, and reliability. This way, you can choose the best suppliers and negotiate better terms. AI can also predict potential disruptions, so you can take action before things go wrong.\n\nSalesforce’s AI capabilities\n\nalso allow for real-time monitoring of supplier performance and proactive management of supply chain risks.\n\nQuality control\n\nKeeping your products top-notch is crucial. AI can analyse production data to spot patterns that might indicate quality issues. Early detection means you can fix problems before they escalate, reducing waste and keeping your customers happy.\n\nExample\n\n: Siemens uses AI to predict and prevent defects in its manufacturing processes, ensuring high product quality and reducing waste. Siemens employs a combination of machine learning algorithms and data visualization techniques to enhance quality control processes. Specifically, they use their SIMATIC S7-1500 technology module, which integrates neural networks to process data in real-time and identify defects. Siemens’ quality control systems use visual data from Surface Mount Technology (SMT) assembly machines to detect defective parts and ensure component authenticity, minimizing recalls and enhancing traceability\n\nBest practices to apply AI to supply chain management\n\nReady to dive in? Here are some tips to make the most of AI in your supply chain.\n\nStart small and scale up\n\nDon’t feel like you need to overhaul everything all at once. Start with a pilot project to test out AI applications and see what works. Maybe try AI-driven demand forecasting for one product line before rolling it out across your entire inventory. This way, you can learn and adjust without major risks.\n\nClean up your data\n\nGood data is the backbone of AI. Invest time and resources in cleaning up your data and making sure it’s integrated across all systems. This will make your AI applications much more effective.\n\nTeam up with experts\n\nIf AI feels overwhelming, don’t hesitate to bring in the pros. Partnering with AI and supply chain experts, like Near Partner, can help you design and implement solutions that work for your business, and also give you access to cutting-edge tools and best practices.\n\nTrain your team\n\nAI is as much about people as it is about technology. Make sure your team knows how to use AI tools and understand the insights they provide. Training is key to getting the most out of your AI investment.\n\nStay secure\n\nMake sure you have robust cybersecurity measures in place to protect your sensitive data. This is crucial for maintaining trust and compliance.\n\nKeep an eye on AI\n\nAI isn’t a set-it-and-forget-it solution. Continuously monitor your AI applications and be ready to make adjustments as needed. Regular reviews will help you refine algorithms and ensure they continue to deliver valuable insights.\n\nNear Partner, your partner for implementing AI in your supply chain management\n\nAI is changing supply chain management. Sure, there are some challenges to overcome, but with the right approach, the advantages far outweigh the downsides. At\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we tailor specific solutions based on Salesforce that help businesses stay ahead of the curve.\n\nGet in touch.",

    "content": "We were at Connected North 2025, one of the UK’s leading telco events. Here are the main highlights.\n\nConnected North is one of the UK’s leading events for connectivity and digital infrastructure, bringing together telecom leaders, policymakers, innovators, and technology providers to explore the future of broadband, 5G, IoT, and smart cities.\n\nPatrícia Peixinho and Sérgio de Melo Cunha returned with insights you won’t find in the official summaries — but that everyone in this industry needs to know.\n\n1. AI isn’t magic. Pretending it is can be dangerous.\n\nAI was everywhere at Connected North — in slides, on panels, embedded in every other sentence. Ayesha Hussain (University of Leeds) said it simply, and effectively:\n\n“\n\nAI is a tool, not the destination.\n\n”\n\nWithout a clear problem to solve or a clean dataset to work with, it’s just confusion dressed as progress.\n\nKatie Atkinson (University of Liverpool) pushed the conversation further with a focus on explainable AI. Because if your model can’t explain its logic — especially in sectors like law, finance or\n\ntelecom\n\n— how can anyone trust it?\n\nAnd then there was Karl Havard (Nscale), who answered the million-dollar question:\n\n“What percentage of people actually know what they’re talking about when they talk about AI?”\n\n2. Fibre is built. Now what?\n\nThe UK has been on a full-speed, fibre-laying frenzy for years. Trenches dug, cables laid, billions spent. Mission accomplished? Not quite. The fibre’s there… but the users? Not always.\n\nThe challenge now isn’t infrastructure. It’s invitation. Getting people to adopt fibre services — especially in underserved, digitally hesitant or rural areas — is the real frontier. It’s no longer enough to build. You have to explain, empower, onboard and support.\n\nThat means digital platforms that make adoption feel easy, human, even enjoyable. Think user onboarding tools that don’t require a decoder ring. Think customer experiences that anticipate needs instead of reacting to problems.\n\nAnd think about this: we’ve connected the country. But have we connected with the users?\n\n3. Consolidation is coming. Is your tech ready?\n\nRob Hamlin (CityFibre) pointed out: market consolidation is probably inevitable. When it hits, things will need to move fast, merge faster, and function without friction.\n\nThis puts a spotlight on flexibility, automation and scalable tech. Operators that can’t integrate quickly will drown in their own complexity. Those that can will turn chaos into competitive advantage.\n\nThe lesson? Be merger-friendly before you’re merger-forced. Build tech that’s less diva, more diplomat.\n\n4. Digital transformation is 80% human, 20% tech\n\nYou can have the best AI, the fastest fibre, and the most polished dashboard on the market… and still fail. Why? Because digital transformation doesn’t happen to systems — it happens to people.\n\nPatrícia and Sérgio heard it loud and clear: real transformation requires cultural change, proper onboarding, digital confidence, and the kind of soft skills that rarely make it into procurement documents.\n\nThe demand is growing for learning platforms, digital onboarding support and accessible tools that help\n\neveryone\n\n— not just the digital elite — transition smoothly. You build transformation person by person.\n\nFinal thoughts: we went looking for signal. We found noise — and decoded it\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we’re ready to help telecom make the shift — from cables to connection, from infrastructure to insight, from machine logic to human value. Want to explore what that shift could look like for your organisation?\n\nLet’s talk\n\n.",

    "content": "Leading healthcare brands around the world are transforming patient experience using a revolutionary tool. This is how Salesforce Health Cloud is powering this major shift.\n\nSalesforce stopped being “just” a CRM a long time ago. What began as a sales tool has evolved into an ecosystem of powerhouse solutions, designed to give businesses a full, panoramic view of their operations. With Salesforce Health Cloud, the same disruptive energy is being channelled into one of the most complex, demanding sectors out there.\n\nSalesforce Health Cloud zeroes in on the real pain points: fragmented patient information, disjointed care journeys, and the constant challenge of turning vast amounts of clinical and operational data into meaningful, actionable insights. And that’s just the beginning. What follows is a closer look at how Salesforce Health Cloud is quietly reshaping the future of connected healthcare. Discover how Salesforce Health Cloud provides the integrated view that healthcare teams have been waiting for.\n\nAt Near Partner, we’re proud to say we were the\n\nfirst to deliver a Salesforce Health Cloud project in the Iberian region\n\n. That pioneering experience has helped us shape tailored solutions for healthcare providers navigating both operational complexity and the urgent need for patient-centered innovation.\n\nWhat is Salesforce Health Cloud?\n\nSalesforce Health Cloud is a cloud-based platform designed specifically for the healthcare industry. It provides healthcare organizations with a\n\nunified view of patient data, enabling them to deliver more personalized and connected care\n\n.\n\nThe platform integrates data from various sources, including electronic health records (EHRs), wearables, and patient interactions, offering a 360-degree view of each patient’s health journey.\n\nTop features of Salesforce Health Cloud\n\nSalesforce Health Cloud is a rethink of how healthcare should\n\nfeel\n\n. It takes the fragmented, frustrating parts of healthcare operations and dares to imagine them seamless, human, and (yes) even a little bit delightful. Let’s unpack some of its smartest moves.\n\n1. Data Cloud for Health: the power of a single patient profile\n\nOne of the biggest technical barriers in healthcare has always been fragmented data. Salesforce Health Cloud tackles this by integrating clinical data, claims, demographics, behavioural, and even social determinants of health into a unified patient profile. Thanks to FHIR-compliant APIs and pre-built healthcare data models, teams get real-time access to comprehensive insights — without the need for heavy coding or complex integrations. It’s a crucial step towards truly informed, whole-person care.\n\n2. Integrated Care Management: dynamic, data-driven care plans\n\nCare management in Salesforce Health Cloud uses flexible care plan frameworks that align with industry guidelines and also adapts to patient-specific assessments and social factors. Automated triggers and intelligent task assignment help care teams prioritise interventions, close gaps, and monitor outcomes continuously. The platform makes sure no patient falls through the cracks — and that care evolves as they do.\n\n3. Crisis Support and Behavioural Health: empathy, engineered\n\nFor behavioural health and crisis interventions, speed and empathy are everything. Salesforce Health Cloud equips crisis centres with optimised workflows for urgent triage, automated escalations, and instant access to critical patient data. This ensures fast, safe responses while maintaining continuity of care. It can turn operational efficiency into life-saving responsiveness.\n\n4. Intelligent Appointment Management: precision scheduling\n\nNo-shows and scheduling conflicts cost both time and trust. Salesforce Health Cloud addresses this with intelligent, rule-based scheduling tools that support agent-assisted bookings, waitlists, and complex scenarios like multi-participant appointments. By integrating scheduling data with patient records, it enables predictive slot management and helps reduce gaps in care delivery.\n\n5. Home Health: the future of remote care\n\nHome health is becoming an expectation. Salesforce Health Cloud supports remote care delivery with automated scheduling workflows, integrated medication tracking, and caregiver slot broadcasting. The platform empowers care teams to manage home visits as efficiently as in-clinic appointments, ensuring that quality of care doesn’t stop at the hospital doors.\n\n6. Contact Center for Health: smarter conversations, faster resolutions\n\nHealth isn’t a 9-to-5 business. Using an out-of-the-box, compliant console application, Salesforce Health Cloud unifies patient interactions across channels — voice, chat, email — and integrates them directly with health records and care plans. This means agents work with complete context, improving first-contact resolution rates and personalising every patient conversation.\n\n7. Provider Relationship and Network Management: streamlined partnerships\n\nManaging provider networks can be a logistical challenge. Salesforce Health Cloud simplifies this with tools to manage recruiting, credentialing, contracting, and referrals in one place. Automated workflows and self-service capabilities reduce administrative overhead and strengthen provider relationships, ensuring patients are always matched with the right care.\n\n8. Utilisation Management: speedier decisions, less bureaucracy\n\nNo one benefits from endless approval loops. Salesforce Health Cloud cuts through red tape by streamlining prior authorisations, appeals, and grievances. It even offers intelligent recommendations, helping teams make faster decisions that keep care moving.\n\nHow to get started with Salesforce Health Cloud\n\nHere’s a practical path to get there.\n\n1. Define your priorities: start with the problems you actually need to solve\n\nBefore you even think about technical configurations, zoom out. Are you trying to reduce appointment no-shows? Improve care coordination across departments? Bring home healthcare to the forefront? Salesforce Health Cloud can do a lot, but your success starts by getting clear on which fires you need to put out first — and which long-term goals you want to achieve.\n\n2. Map your data ecosystem: understand what you’re working with\n\nSalesforce Health Cloud’s strength is in\n\nunifying data\n\n, but first, you need to know where your data lives. Map your electronic health records (EHR), claims data, patient interactions, and external sources like wearables or third-party apps. The goal here is to prepare for clean integrations and ensure data flows smoothly into the Health Cloud environment.\n\n3. Get specialist support: don’t go for it alone\n\nHere’s where many teams go off track. Salesforce Health Cloud is powerful, but its potential hinges on smart implementation — and that’s where experienced specialists make all the difference. A\n\nSalesforce-certified partner\n\n, like\n\nNear Partner\n\n, can tailor the platform to your specific processes, avoid common pitfalls, and accelerate your rollout\n\n4. Pilot, test, and refine: real-world testing matters\n\nOnce your systems are connected and workflows are designed, start with a controlled rollout. Test real-world scenarios: scheduling complexities, crisis support responsiveness, home health integrations. Gather feedback from care teams and operational staff early. Small iterations at this stage will avoid major headaches later.\n\n5. Focus on adoption and culture: technology alone isn’t enough\n\nEven the smartest platform fails without adoption. Invest time in training and change management. Help teams see how Salesforce Health Cloud simplifies their day-to-day, and involve them in shaping workflows. A culture of digital-first, patient-centric care is what ultimately makes the system work in practice.\n\nWe love success stories: EZFY\n\nEzfy\n\nis a fast-growing healthcare provider working with pharmacies to support patients with chronic and high-risk conditions. As they expanded, they faced a harsh reality — manual processes and scattered data were holding them back.\n\nEzfy’s growth was exciting, but it brought major operational risks including manual patient tracking, scattered communication between pharmacies and Ezfy, limited visibility over patient journeys and no real-time updates, meaning critical moments could be missed.\n\nHere’s how we helped:\n\nCentralized, real-time patient monitoring.\n\nOne place to see every patient’s journey, in real time, without data silos.\n\nSeamless collaboration with pharmacies.\n\nPharmacies gained direct access to the tools and insights they need to engage patients, manage medications, and coordinate interventions smoothly.\n\nAutomated critical workflows.\n\nFrom enrolment to follow-ups, tasks that once took hours now happen automatically — reducing errors and freeing up time for genuine patient care.\n\nUser-friendly interfaces for on-the-ground teams.\n\nField teams work better with tools built for them. Updates, tracking, and patient status checks are fast and effortless.\n\nFuture-proof scalability.\n\nThe system is ready for tomorrow’s growth, new partners, and evolving patient needs.\n\nThis resulted in faster onboarding for pharmacies and partners, full visibility across every patient journey, and tighter coordination. It also enabled timely, proactive patient support that prevents gaps in care. They are also better equipped to scale as the network grows.\n\nWith Near Partner by their side, Ezfy turned operational complexity into clarity — and patient care into a proactive, data-driven experience.\n\nDeliver excellence in healthcare with Salesforce Health Cloud\n\nThe Salesforce Health Cloud brings real, human connection back into healthcare processes. It bridges the gap between patients and healthcare teams, making interactions feel less like transactions and more like genuine care. It helps healthcare providers move faster, smarter, and with a system architecture that’s actually designed to be used — not fought against.\n\nStill wondering if Salesforce Health Cloud fits your needs? At\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we’ve helped plenty of healthcare teams figure out exactly that. Whether you’re ready to start mapping out your next steps or you’re just exploring possibilities, we’re here to help you make sense of the options — and spot the blind spots you might not even know you have.

    "content": "Discover what financial reconciliation is, how it can help your business and how to do it right.\n\nEvery year, businesses\n\nlose an average of $145,000 to poor financial reconciliation\n\n. That’s average – when reconciliation is manual, delayed, or incomplete, those gaps grow wider. But done right, financial reconciliation helps you catch errors early, close control gaps, and keep your business secure. Discover what it is, and to make it right and how automation can protect you.\n\nDiscover what financial reconciliation is, how it can help your business and how to do it right.\n\nWhat is financial reconciliation?\n\nPut simply, financial reconciliation is the accounting term for verifying that financial records from different sources match. It involves comparing internal accounting data — like general ledgers or transaction reports — with external documents, such as\n\nbank statements\n\n, vendor records, or payment processor logs. Any discrepancies that arise during this comparison are flagged, investigated, and corrected to ensure the integrity of financial reporting.\n\nThis process is critical for maintaining transparency, preventing errors, and\n\nensuring compliance\n\n. Reconciliation helps teams stay confident that the numbers they’re working with are reliable. It’s not just about catching mistakes — though that’s important — but about building a solid foundation for smarter decisions, audits, and strategic planning.\n\nWhy financial reconciliation matters\n\nThe main benefit of a strong financial reconciliation is, obviously, not losing unclaimed money to either vendors or customers. But there are other important benefits you gain by making financial reconciliation a consistent habit.\n\n1. Accurate financial data\n\nRegular reconciliation ensures that your financial data is consistent and error-free. By identifying mismatches early, you reduce the risk of misstatements in your reports, avoid costly mistakes, and keep your numbers aligned with reality.\n\n2. Stronger internal controls\n\nReconciliation acts as a checkpoint against fraud, duplicate or missing payments, or unauthorized transactions. It adds an extra layer of oversight, making it easier to detect irregularities and reinforcing accountability across financial operations.\n\n3. Smoother audits\n\nWhen your records are consistently reconciled, audits become far less stressful. Everything is in order, easier to trace, and quicker to validate. That means less scrambling and fewer questions.\n\n4. Informed decision-making\n\nClean and up-to-date financials lead to better strategic decisions. Reconciliation gives leadership teams the confidence to plan, invest, and grow based on data they trust, without second-guessing what’s real and what’s a reporting error.\n\n5. Enhanced cash flow visibility\n\nBy reconciling your books with real-world transactions, you get a clearer picture of where your money is, where it’s going, and how it’s being used. This visibility helps with forecasting, budgeting, and staying agile in changing conditions.\n\nThe main types of financial reconciliation\n\nThere are different types of financial reconciliation that serve different purposes, depending on the data you’re working with and the outcomes you need.\n\n1. Bank reconciliation\n\nThis is the most common type. It involves comparing a company’s internal cash records with bank statements to ensure all deposits, withdrawals, and balances match. It helps spot missed transactions, bank fees, or fraudulent activity.\n\n2. Customer reconciliation\n\nFocused on accounts receivable, this process compares a company’s records of customer invoices and payments with the balances reported by the customer. It’s essential for maintaining clean ledgers and resolving payment disputes quickly.\n\n3. Vendor reconciliation\n\nAlso known as supplier reconciliation, this compares the company’s accounts payable records with vendor statements. It ensures that all received goods and services have been accurately recorded and paid for, without duplicates or surprises.\n\n4. Intercompany reconciliation\n\nUsed by businesses with multiple entities or subsidiaries, this process ensures that transactions between those entities are correctly recorded on both sides. It’s vital for consolidating financials and avoiding discrepancies within the group.\n\n5. Credit card reconciliation\n\nThis matches internal expense records with credit card statements. It helps verify that all charges are valid, properly categorized, and aligned with company policies — which is especially useful for managing employee or business credit cards.\n\n6. Balance sheet reconciliation\n\nA broader process that reviews and validates the balances of key accounts — like assets, liabilities, and equity — at the end of a reporting period. It ensures the financial statements are complete and accurately reflect the company’s position.\n\nHow to get financial reconciliation right\n\nWith the right structure and tools in place, reconciliation can become a smooth part of your finance routine.\n\n1. Define a clear process\n\nStart with a structured approach. Set steps, assign responsibilities, and make sure everyone follows the same routine. A consistent process helps reduce mistakes and makes the work easier to manage across teams.\n\n2. Reconcile frequently\n\nDon’t wait until the end of the month to start reviewing your records. The more often you reconcile, the easier it is to catch and correct issues. This keeps your data more accurate and saves time in the long run.\n\n3. Organize your documentation\n\nKeep your financial records — like invoices, bank statements, and receipts — well-organized and easy to access. Good documentation speeds up the reconciliation process and supports transparency during internal checks or audits.\n\n4. Use automation and trusted technology partners\n\nManual work takes time and increases the risk of errors. Automating parts of your reconciliation process helps reduce those risks and frees up your team to focus on more valuable tasks. At\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we build custom solutions that adapt to your workflows, helping you automate what makes sense and simplify the rest. We’re here to support your finance team with the right tech.\n\n5. Review and improve regularly\n\nEven a good process can be improved. Make time to review your reconciliation workflow, gather input from your team, and adjust where needed. Continuous improvements lead to better results and fewer issues over time.\n\nThe power of automation in financial reconciliation\n\nAutomation fundamentally changes how reconciliation gets done, making it more reliable, scalable, and insightful. Here’s how automation steps in to handle the heavy lifting and make your finance operations smarter every day.\n\nSeamless data integration\n\nAutomation connects multiple financial systems — bank feeds, accounting software, payment gateways — pulling data together in real time. This removes the need for manual data entry and ensures you’re working with the freshest information, without delays or mismatches.\n\nSmart transaction matching\n\nAutomated systems use configurable rules to handle exceptions and partial matches. They can recognize patterns like recurring payments or split transactions, reducing false mismatches and minimizing manual reviews.\n\nDynamic exception handling\n\nWhen transactions don’t match, automation doesn’t just flag the problem — it prioritizes issues based on risk or value, suggests possible reasons, and even recommends next steps. This turns reconciliation from a reactive chore into a proactive process.\n\nAutomated documentation and audit trails\n\nEvery matched or flagged transaction is logged with full traceability, and supporting documents are automatically linked and stored. This built-in audit trail saves time during reviews and builds trust in your financial data integrity.\n\nMake financial reconciliation smarter with Near Partner\n\nReconciliation doesn’t have to be a drain on your team’s time or energy. With the right tools in place, it becomes faster, more accurate, and way easier to manage.\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we take the time to understand how your processes work, and we build smart, flexible automation around them. If you need better integrations, custom dashboards, or a fully automated reconciliation flow, we’re here to make it all work — the way it should.\n\nLet’s talk\n\n. We’d love to hear how you work — and help you build a smarter to do it.",

    "content": "Avoid these 7 mistakes and build scalable solutions that grow with your business, not against it.\n\nIn 2018, Best Buy, a name synonymous with consumer electronics, made a move that few saw coming: it entered the healthcare market.\n\nAt first glance, this seemed like an odd direction for the retail giant. But the company, under the leadership of then-CEO Hubert Joly, saw an opportunity.\n\nBest Buy Health’s focus was on helping the elderly age safely at home, tapping into a growing market\n\nforecast to reach $265 billion by 2025\n\n. By 2022, this venture had grown into a $525 million business, with a projected annual growth rate of 35% to 45%.\n\nThis wasn’t just a stroke of luck – it was a textbook example of successful scaling. Best Buy didn’t stop at brainstorming or testing ideas. The company moved through the critical stages of innovation: ideation, incubation, and scaling.\n\nWhile 80% of companies can come up with ideas and test them, only 16% manage to scale them successfully\n\n. So, what’s the secret? How did Best Buy manage to make its venture work while others stumble?\n\nThe answer lies in a few key decisions that any company looking to scale needs to get right. Avoiding these seven common pitfalls could be the difference between scaling successfully or falling short. Let’s take a closer look.\n\nWhat is a scalable solution?\n\nSimply put, scalable solutions are systems or platforms that can handle increased demand – more users, more data, more transactions – without losing performance or maintaining a great experience. They evolve with your business, ensuring you won’t be caught off guard as your needs grow.\n\nThat being said, scalability it’s a fundamental business necessity for every company. Yet, too many companies fall into the same traps when trying to build these solutions.\n\n7 key pitfalls to avoid when scaling\n\nBuilding scalable solutions is crucial for long-term success, but it’s easy to fall into common traps that can slow down your growth.\n\n1. Overcomplicating the architecture from the start\n\nYou envision massive success, and your gut tells you to build a system that’s capable of handling millions of users or vast amounts of data. But here’s the catch: trying to over-engineer your system from day one can backfire.\n\nWhen you layer complexity on top of complexity before you’ve even solved the current problem, your solution will likely become bloated and harder to manage. Scalability doesn’t mean anticipating every possible future scenario; it’s about building a flexible, strong foundation that can grow and adapt as you need it to.\n\nPro tip:\n\nStart with the essentials. Focus on building a simple, efficient system that solves today’s problems. Add complexity when the need arises, not before.\n\n2. Ignoring the importance of data management\n\nIf you’ve ever faced issues with data scaling, you’ll know how crucial this is. A scalable solution isn’t scalable if its data is a mess. Poorly structured data, inconsistent formats, or inefficient storage methods can cause even the most well-designed systems to collapse as they grow.\n\nA common mistake? Putting off a solid\n\ndata management\n\nstrategy until it’s too late. But when your data starts piling up, the lack of a strong foundation can grind everything to a halt.\n\nPro tip:\n\nDesign your data architecture with scalability in mind from the beginning. Structure your data well, plan for growth, and ensure your system can handle more sources and types of data without falling apart.\n\n3. Believing low-code can’t scale\n\nLow-code platforms are often dismissed as tools for simple apps or quick prototypes, with critics claiming they crumble under the pressure of large-scale, complex demands.\n\nThis misconception leads businesses to overlook low-code as a viable solution for enterprise-level challenges. Worse, it can result in underestimating the potential of the platform, leading to poor implementation practices, lack of governance, or over-reliance on default templates that don’t optimize performance.\n\nThe reality is that modern\n\nlow-code\n\nplatforms are built for scalability. With the right architecture, thoughtful design, and adherence to best practices, they can handle high transaction volumes, integrate with other enterprise systems, and support long-term growth. In fact,\n\nlow-code often accelerates scaling\n\nby reducing development cycles and allowing for rapid adjustments.\n\n[Sd3]\n\n[BB4]\n\nPro tip:\n\nTreat low-code with the same strategic rigor as any other development approach. Partnering with experts like\n\nNear Partner\n\n, who understand the nuances of low-code platforms, can make all the difference.\n\n4. Underestimating the impact of third-party integrations\n\nThird-party tools and services can give your business a huge boost, but relying too heavily on them without considering long-term scalability is a major pitfall. Many companies make the mistake of integrating tools that work fine initially\n\n,\n\nbut start to buckle when the volume increases. Will that payment processor still work when you have 100,000 customers, or are you going to be stuck with performance issues and slowdowns that frustrate both you and your users?\n\nPro tip:\n\nAlways check if third-party services can scale along with your needs. Don’t just settle for what works today – look for long-term solutions that can grow with you, and plan for the possibility of having to switch if your needs evolve.\n\n5. Failure to test for scalability early on\n\nFar too often, companies wait until their system is overwhelmed to realize that it can’t handle the growth. By then, it’s too late to fix without significant downtime or a complete overhaul.\n\nNot testing for scalability early means you’re blind to potential bottlenecks, inefficient processes, or weak points in your system that could be disastrous down the line. So, don’t wait for problems to arise – test\n\nbefore\n\nyou need to scale, not after you’re already knee-deep in a crisis.\n\nPro tip:\n\nImplement performance and stress testing from the very beginning. Simulate real-world scenarios where your system is expected to grow and monitor how it performs. The earlier you identify weak points, the easier it is to fix them.\n\n6. Neglecting to plan for maintenance and support\n\nOnce you build a scalable solution, the work doesn’t stop. Maintaining a scalable solution requires constant monitoring, troubleshooting, and fine-tuning. If you forget about this aspect, your system might run smoothly at first but deteriorate quickly under increased load.\n\nPro tip:\n\nPlan for regular monitoring and maintenance.\n\nAutomate routine tasks\n\n, stay ahead of performance issues, and ensure you have the team in place to handle emerging problems as they arise.\n\n7. Scaling too quickly without the right resources\n\nIt’s exciting when things start to take off, and the temptation to scale rapidly can be overwhelming. But scaling too quickly without the necessary expertise or infrastructure can cause you to outgrow your own resources, leading to stress, mismanagement, and ultimately a solution that’s not up to par.\n\nPro Tip:\n\nMake sure your infrastructure, team, and processes are ready for growth. Don’t rush into scaling; be sure you’ve got the foundation and support necessary to manage the added complexity.\n\nBuilding scalable solutions: a step-by-step guide\n\nHere’s a step-by-step approach to building scalable solutions that stand the test of time.Here’s a step-by-step approach to building scalable solutions that stand the test of time.\n\n1. Start with a future-proof data architecture\n\nYour data architecture is the backbone of scalability. A poorly planned structure can create bottlenecks as your data volume grows.\n\nOne critical aspect of scalability is ensuring that requests from the Frontend are not lost due to timeouts. Properly allocating resources to handle these requests is essential. An architecture based on Domain-Driven Development (DDD) or microservices can help optimize this allocation by prioritizing the most frequently used services.\n\nAdditionally, in the backend, adopting asynchronous communication using protocols such as AMQP is highly recommended to ensure that:\n\nEach service operates independently, avoiding direct dependencies that could hinder execution.\n\nRequests between services are stored until they are processed, preventing any loss of data.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nChoose a modular, cloud-native architecture. Use relational databases for structured data and NoSQL for unstructured or highly dynamic data. Implement indexing strategies and partitioning to optimize query performance.\n\nAt Near Partner, we have successfully applied these principles in projects like\n\nDe Grisogono\n\n, where we built a scalable solution capable of handling high-performance demands while ensuring reliability and efficiency. By leveraging a well-structured architecture and the right data management strategies, we created a system that meets business needs while remaining resilient under load.\n\n2. Design for integration from the ground up\n\nScalable solutions rarely exist in isolation. Your system must play well with others, such as CRM software, analytics tools, or third-party APIs.\n\nWhat to do\n\n: Choose APIs and applications with strong documentation, version control, and flexibility for future upgrades. Ensure your integration strategy supports asynchronous communication to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n3. Build secure and scalable access management\n\nAs your user base grows, managing access and permissions becomes more complex. Neglect this, and scalability becomes a security nightmare.\n\nWhat to do\n\n: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and single sign-on (SSO). Use identity providers like Okta or Azure AD for centralizing user authentication.\n\nConsidering the\n\nTupperware\n\nproject, Near Partner implemented the role-based access control (RBAC) model to ensure detailed and efficient access management, allowing users to view information, access menus, and perform actions based on the specific permissions associated with their roles. This also added significant flexibility to how permissions are managed and how responsibilities are assigned to individuals overseeing various processes, optimizing the management of hierarchies within the extensive ecosystem.\n\n4. Optimize your backend infrastructure\n\nOne critical aspect of scalability is ensuring that requests from the Frontend are not lost due to timeouts. Properly allocating resources to handle these requests is essential. An architecture based on Domain-Driven Development (DDD) or microservices can help optimize this allocation by prioritizing the most frequently used services.\n\nAdditionally, in the backend, adopting asynchronous communication using protocols such as AMQP is highly recommended to ensure that:\n\nEach service operates independently, avoiding direct dependencies that could hinder execution.\n\nRequests between services are stored until they are processed, preventing any loss of data.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, teams can build resilient and scalable solutions that efficiently handle high loads and maintain system reliability.\n\nWhat to do\n\n: Add load balancers to distribute traffic efficiently and implement auto-scaling on cloud platforms like AWS or Azure.\n\n5. Implement strong governance for low-code development\n\nLow-code platforms can scale if managed well, but without governance, they can become a nightmare of redundant apps and inefficiencies.\n\nWhat to do\n\n: Define coding standards, enforce version control, and monitor platform performance. Train your teams to design for scalability within the low-code framework.\n\n6. Plan for elastic scalability in the cloud\n\nScalability today almost always involves the cloud. But moving to the cloud without a clear strategy can lead to overprovisioning (wasting resources) or underprovisioning (performance issues).\n\nWhat to do\n\n: Use cloud services with elastic scalability, such as serverless computing or container orchestration. Implement cost management tools to avoid runaway bills.\n\n7. Test, monitor, and iterate\n\nScalability isn’t a one-time effort; it’s an ongoing process. Systems that scale today might struggle tomorrow as technology evolves and demands change.\n\nWhat to do\n\n: Stress-test your systems regularly, simulate peak loads, and refine based on real-world data. Set up automated alerts for key performance indicators.\n\nReady to build smart, scalable solutions?\n\nThe road to scalable solutions is full of potential pitfalls, but avoiding these seven mistakes will put you on the path to sustainable growth. By focusing on simplicity, maintaining data integrity, ensuring your third-party tools can scale, testing early, planning for ongoing support, and not rushing to scale without the right resources, you’ll be building a system that can evolve with your business.\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we specialize in\n\nsoftware development\n\n,\n\nlow-code solutions\n\n, and\n\nSalesforce consultancy\n\n, ensuring that the solutions we build are not only scalable but also practical and future-proof.\n\nReach out today\n\nand let us help you build the foundation that can support your business as it grows.",

    "content": "No one needs “business as usual”. It’s time to redesign your customer journey and see how loyalty truly sticks.\n\nIt’s 2014 and\n\nAnne Boden\n\n, a top exec at a major multinational bank, has just walked away from her cushy, secure role. Why? Because she’s tired of the outdated, customer-last approach of traditional banking. Armed with guts, a bit of frustration, and a consultancy team, she maps out the so-called “customer journey” of bank clients. What she finds is a mess of inefficiencies and “pain points” that make no sense.\n\nFast-forward to today, and Boden’s Starling Bank isn’t just thriving – it’s a key player in the financial world, crowned the UK’s best bank four years running. The secret? Ripping up the old customer journey playbook and designing a fresh, intuitive path for modern users. Anne Boden didn’t just tweak a few processes; she completely reimagined the system and started a movement. And it all began with rethinking the customer journey.\n\nSo, let’s start from the top. What exactly is a customer journey, and why should you care? More importantly, how can you leverage tools to create a journey that goes beyond expectations? Let’s find out.\n\nWhat is a customer journey, really?\n\nThe customer journey is a sequence of touchpoints that begins even before a person becomes a customer. It starts with brand awareness, progressing to a purchase, and ideally, culminating in lasting loyalty. By analysing and optimizing this journey, businesses gain insights into their\n\ncustomers’ experiences\n\n, enabling them to enhance every interaction along the way.\n\nIn a world where trust is harder to earn than ever, optimizing every single touchpoint isn’t optional – it’s the difference between being the brand people rave about – or the one they ghost.\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nHere’s why mastering your customer journey is critical.\n\n1. Retention is the new acquisition\n\nAcquiring new customers is expensive –\n\nup to five times more costly than retaining existing ones\n\n. A well-crafted customer journey ensures satisfaction and fosters loyalty, turning one-time buyers into repeat customers. Loyal customers spend more, refer others, and act as advocates for your brand.\n\n2. Experience is the ultimate differentiator\n\nProducts and services can be copied, but a stellar experience is unique to your brand. In fact,\n\n73% of customers say that experience is a key factor in their purchasing decisions\n\n. When you prioritize the customer journey, you’re doing more than just selling a product – you’re delivering value and building trust.\n\n3. Revenue follows relationships\n\nA seamless, engaging customer journey directly impacts your bottom line. Studies show that brands with a good customer experience can\n\nincrease revenue by 2–7%\n\n. Every interaction – from the first click to post-purchase follow-ups – can be optimized to drive conversions and revenue.\n\n4. Customer journeys give out valuable inputs\n\nYour customer journey is a\n\ngoldmine of data\n\n. Tracking behaviours, preferences, and pain points provides invaluable insights to refine your strategy. This data helps you predict future trends, personalize interactions, and stay ahead of the competition.\n\nKey elements of the customer journey\n\nHere are the elements to be mastered to create an unforgettable experience.\n\n1. Awareness\n\nThis is where it all begins. How do potential customers discover your brand? It could be through an ad, a social media post, or a recommendation from a friend. Effective SEO, well-targeted advertisements, and a strong online presence can ensure your brand gets noticed. The goal here is to spark curiosity and make a memorable first impression.\n\n2. Consideration\n\nAt this stage, customers are evaluating their options. What makes your brand stand out? High-quality, personalized content such as case studies, testimonials, and engaging product demonstrations can make all the difference. Stellar reviews and competitive advantages should shine here, to build confidence in your offering.\n\n3. Purchase\n\nThis is the make-or-break moment. Is the buying process smooth, intuitive, and secure? A seamless checkout process with multiple payment options can significantly reduce cart abandonment rates. Eliminate unnecessary friction – because even the smallest hiccup can send customers running to your competitors.\n\n4. Post-purchase\n\nThe journey doesn’t end when the transaction is complete. Post-purchase is your chance to turn a customer into a loyal advocate. Strategies like personalized thank-you emails, proactive customer support, and loyalty programs keep customers engaged and coming back for more. This stage is also crucial for gathering feedback to refine future interactions.\n\nHere’s a visual breakdown of a customer journey mapping, highlighting key touchpoints, essential stages, and the channels that shape the experience.\n\nHow to create an exceptional customer journey\n\nIt’s time to create a strategy that’s data-driven, customer-centric, and tech-empowered. Here’s how to make it happen.\n\n1. Understand your customers inside and out\n\nBefore you design anything, you need to know who you’re designing for. Gather insights about your customers – what motivates them, what frustrates them, and what they value most. Use surveys, analytics, and interviews to get a crystal-clear picture of their needs.\n\nActionable steps:\n\nDevelop buyer personas:\n\nCreate detailed profiles representing your ideal customers, including demographics, pain points, and behaviours.\n\nAnalyse customer data:\n\nLeverage tools like Salesforce\n\nto pull data from multiple sources and identify patterns in customer interactions.\n\nListen actively:\n\nPay attention to social media comments, support tickets, and feedback forms to understand your audience’s real-time needs.\n\n2. Map the journey, from start to finish\n\nA journey map is your blueprint. It visualizes every interaction a customer has with your brand, from discovery to loyalty. Don’t sugarcoat it – be honest about where the gaps and pain points are.\n\nActionable steps:\n\nList all touchpoints:\n\nIdentify every place your customers interact with your brand. It could be ads, websites, apps, support teams, among others.\n\nAssess the flow:\n\nMap out how customers move from one stage to the next. Are there bottlenecks or unnecessary friction?\n\nUse tools to simulate the journey:\n\nLow-code platforms\n\ncan quickly help you prototype and test improved workflows without overhauling your entire system.\n\n3. Prioritize personalization\n\nToday’s customers expect experiences that feel tailored to them, but there’s a fine line between helpful and intrusive. Use the data you’ve gathered to create meaningful interactions at every stage of the user journey.\n\nActionable steps:\n\nSegment your audience:\n\nGroup customers based on shared characteristics and preferences to deliver more relevant experiences.\n\nAutomate smart recommendations:\n\nTools like\n\nSalesforce AI\n\ncan recommend products or services based on past behaviours therefore increasing conversion rates.\n\nKeep it real-time:\n\nPersonalization works best when it’s immediate – whether it’s a dynamic email, custom landing page, or in-app message.\n\n4. Streamline processes for speed and simplicity\n\nCustomers are impatient. If they hit a roadblock, they’ll move on. Simplify every step of the journey, from discovery to post-purchase, to keep them engaged.\n\nActionable steps:\n\nEliminate unnecessary steps:\n\nAudit your processes and remove redundancies. For instance, cut down on the number of clicks needed to make a purchase.\n\nIntegrate systems seamlessly:\n\nUse custom software to connect your\n\nCRM\n\n, e-commerce platform, and\n\ncommunication tools\n\nfor a frictionless experience.\n\nOffer self-service options:\n\nLet customers solve simple issues on their own with FAQs, chatbots, or an intuitive help center.\n\n5. Gather feedback and iterate continuously\n\nYour user journey is a breathing system that requires constant attention.

    "content": "Telecom’s challenges are everywhere, from AI to security. Here are our top 14 picks and how to beat them.\n\nFrom aging infrastructure to cybersecurity threats, from AI integration to customer expectations that never stop rising, telecom companies are juggling complexity at every level. The pressure to modernize, stay competitive, and deliver flawless service is relentless.\n\nIn this article, we break down\n\n14 of the biggest challenges facing telecom today\n\n— and more importantly,\n\nhow forward-thinking companies are overcoming them\n\n.\n\n1. Updating age-old systems without breaking the bank\n\nTelecom companies have long been burdened by outdated legacy systems – monolithic infrastructures designed for an era that no longer exists. While these systems may still function, they create massive roadblocks to modernization, operational efficiency, and cybersecurity. The industry’s reliance on aging technology is a key challenge in delivering the agile, data-driven services that modern consumers and businesses expect.\n\nWhy it’s a problem:\n\nLegacy systems require extensive resources to maintain, draining budgets that could otherwise be invested in innovation.\n\nThese systems do not seamlessly connect with modern digital platforms, leading to inefficiencies and poor user experiences.\n\nOutdated technology is a prime target for cybercriminals, increasing the risk of data breaches and service disruptions.\n\nHow to win:\n\nA full-scale infrastructure overhaul is often impractical, both in terms of cost and operational disruption. Instead, a strategic modernization approach is key:\n\nAdopt API-driven integrations:\n\nImplement APIs to enable\n\nlegacy systems\n\nto communicate with modern digital solutions, bridging the gap without requiring a full system replacement.\n\nPrioritize cloud migration:\n\nShifting to cloud-based services enhances agility, scalability, and cost efficiency, making it easier to deploy new capabilities quickly.\n\nEmbrace microservices architecture:\n\nBreaking down monolithic systems into modular, independent components enables faster updates and innovation without overhauling the entire system.\n\n2. Dealing with rising customer expectations and lower price points\n\nToday’s telecom customers have zero patience for friction. If their billing experience feels like deciphering hieroglyphics, they’ll switch providers fast.\n\nWhy it’s a problem:\n\nCustomers demand hyper-personalized, omnichannel experiences.\n\nFrustration with slow support or confusing services leads to churn.\n\nAI-powered competitors are setting new benchmarks in CX.\n\nHow to win:\n\nDeploy AI-driven customer insights:\n\nUse\n\npredictive analytics\n\nto anticipate issues and address them before customers even notice.\n\nInvest in self-service platforms:\n\nEmpower customers with AI chatbots, interactive FAQs, and automated troubleshooting to reduce dependency on human support agents.\n\nOptimize real-time issue resolution:\n\nImplement intelligent ticketing systems and automated workflows to accelerate problem resolution.\n\n3. Why Telecoms Must Prioritize Cybersecurity\n\nAs telecom companies accelerate digital transformation, they also become more attractive targets for cybercriminals. The vast amounts of sensitive customer data, coupled with increasingly interconnected networks, make\n\ncybersecurity\n\na top priority.\n\nWhy it’s a problem:\n\nTelecom providers store extensive personal and financial data, making them prime candidates for cyberattacks.\n\nThe growth of 5G, IoT, and cloud services introduces more potential vulnerabilities.\n\nCybercriminals continually refine their tactics, using AI-driven attacks, ransomware, and persistent threats to breach defenses.\n\nHow to win:\n\nAdopt a zero-trust security model:\n\nAssume all network traffic is potentially malicious and enforce strict access controls.\n\nImplement real-time threat monitoring:\n\nReal-time monitoring and AI-driven threat detection can stop attacks in their tracks before they cause any harm.\n\nAutomate incident response:\n\nUse automated systems to respond to breaches instantly, minimizing potential harm.\n\nTrain employees continuously:\n\nPhishing attacks are one of the easiest ways hackers get in. Your employees need to know how to spot them.\n\n4. Bypassing the “we’ve always done it this way” mindset\n\nTechnology is one thing. People are the real challenge. Employees stuck in their ways often resist change, dragging their feet when it comes to adopting new tools and processes. If your team isn’t fully on board with your transformation goals, your technology investments will be wasted.\n\nWhy it’s a problem:\n\nHesitant employees can prevent companies from realizing the full benefits of new technologies.\n\nTraditional corporate cultures can become insular, making it difficult to innovate at speed.\n\nEmployees who lack digital skills will slow down your progress, forcing you to play catch-up.\n\nHow to win:\n\nFoster a mindset of innovation:\n\nDon’t just tell people about change. Show them the benefits. Make digital transformation exciting, not scary.\n\nUpskill your workforce:\n\nContinuous learning and development should be a core part of your strategy.\n\nEmpower teams to lead change:\n\nInvolve employees from day one, give them a voice, and provide incentives for digital-first thinking.\n\n5. Keeping up with constantly changing rules\n\nTelecom is one of the most heavily regulated sectors in the world. GDPR, FCC rules, data sovereignty laws – keeping up with the constantly shifting landscape of regulations is like trying to hit a moving target. But miss, and the consequences can be severe: heavy fines, legal action, and a damaged reputation.\n\nWhy it’s a problem:\n\nWhat’s compliant in one country could be a violation in another, making global operations challenging.\n\nThe laws governing telecom are constantly evolving, often with little notice.\n\nThe fines and penalties for breaking regulations can be devastating.\n\nHow to win:\n\nAutomate regulatory tracking:\n\nUse AI and regulatory tech to stay on top of rule changes in real time.\n\nPartner with legal tech firms:\n\nStay ahead by collaborating with firms that specialize in telecom regulations.\n\nIntegrate compliance into business operations:\n\nCompliance shouldn’t be an afterthought. Make it part of your digital transformation journey, and you’ll be ready.\n\n6. Dealing with coverage outages\n\nYou’re offering connectivity, but what happens when your service\n\ndisconnects\n\nat the worst possible moment? Coverage outages are not just an inconvenience, they’re a trust killer. One bad experience could send your customers straight to the competition. In an era where 5G promises seamless connections, you can’t afford to drop calls.\n\nWhy it’s a problem:\n\nPeople are more dependent than ever on their telecom service, whether for work, personal communication, or emergency needs. Interruptions are unacceptable.\n\nEnterprises rely heavily on telecom services for operations. A loss of connectivity can bring business activities to a grinding halt.\n\nThe cost of downtime for telecom companies – both in terms of lost revenue and damage to brand loyalty – is massive.\n\nHow to win:\n\nEnhance network resilience\n\n: Invest in infrastructure that can dynamically reroute traffic or self-heal in case of disruptions.\n\nImplement predictive maintenance\n\n: Use AI to predict failures before they cripple your operations.\n\nImprove communication during outages\n\n: Don’t go silent during service disruptions. Use proactive communication to keep them informed and manage expectations.\n\n7. Finding the right skills\n\nThe competition for skilled workers is fierce everywhere and telecom companies are not immune. Attracting and retaining the right employees is and will become increasingly difficult.\n\nWhy it’s a problem:\n\nAI developers, data scientists, and cybersecurity experts are in high demand, and short supply.\n\nMany current employees lack the advanced digital skills necessary for a successful transformation.\n\nThe best talent is constantly being poached by other industries, which leaves telecoms struggling to hold onto key players.\n\nHow to win:\n\nInvest in training and development:\n\nUpskilling existing employees not only fills the gap but also fosters loyalty.\n\nLeverage remote work:\n\nExpand your talent pool by hiring from a broader geographical range.\n\nCreate a competitive work environment:\n\nOffer incentives like flexible working hours, professional development opportunities, and career growth paths to attract and retain top talent.\n\n8. Reducing your environment footprint\n\nTelecom’s carbon footprint may not get the bad press other industries do, but it’s massive. In an age where sustainability is an expectation, sticking with outdated, energy-hungry infrastructure is a PR disaster waiting to happen.\n\nWhy it’s a problem:\n\nWith infrastructure that’s often outdated, your carbon footprint is growing, while your customers’ concerns about sustainability are increasing.\n\nConsumers, especially younger generations, are actively seeking companies that prioritize sustainability.\n\nGovernments worldwide are tightening environmental regulations. Failure to adapt could result in fines, lawsuits, or even reputation-damaging campaigns.\n\nHow to win:\n\nGreen your operations:\n\nTransition to renewable energy sources, reduce waste, and embrace energy-efficient technologies. Show your customers that your commitment to sustainability is as strong as your network.\n\nCommunicate your efforts:\n\nDon’t wait for criticism. Let your customers know the steps you’re taking to reduce your environmental impact. Transparency builds trust.\n\n9. Delivering true empathy\n\nCustomer service\n\nin telecom is often the first and last line of defense for customer loyalty. And yet, many telecom companies still rely on outdated, clunky support models that frustrate customers and push them straight into the arms of competitors. It’s no longer enough to simply be responsive; today’s consumers expect instant, personalized service.\n\nWhy it’s a problem:\n\nEndless hold times, unhelpful agents, and the dreaded “press 1 for this” make telecom support a nightmare. When service is this painful, customer loss is almost inevitable.\n\nOne bad interaction can undo years of trust-building. Negative experiences get shared, retweeted, and discussed across every social platform – with no second chances.\n\nMeanwhile, your competitors are embracing AI-driven support that’s instant, intelligent, and personal. While you’re still trapped in traditional service models, they’re already ahead, offering customers everything they want, right when they need it.\n\nHow to win:\n\nCreate proactive experiences:\n\nPredict and resolve problems before customers even notice. Use customer insights to anticipate their needs and offer solutions ahead of time. Be the provider that sees the issues before they do.\n\nTrain like your business depends on it (it does):\n\nEquip your staff with the right training and tools to provide immediate, personalized service. Real empathy and efficiency are the real game changers in customer service.\n\n10. Bringing AI into daily operations\n\nAI promises efficiency, but too often, it ends up as just another tool employees struggle to use. If it doesn’t integrate seamlessly, adoption stalls, productivity suffers, and investments go to waste. The challenge isn’t AI itself, it’s how you bring it into daily workflows.\n\nWhy it’s a problem:\n\nIf AI isn’t intuitive, it slows teams down instead of speeding them up.\n\nEmployees won’t adopt AI if it feels like an extra burden.\n\nAI initiatives often get stuck in test phases, never delivering real impact.\n\nHow to win:\n\nMake AI invisible.\n\nEmbed it into existing systems so it works in the background, not as an extra step.\n\nPrioritize ease of use.\n\nIf AI doesn’t feel effortless, people won’t use it.\n\nDeploy, refine, scale.\n\nStart small, optimize based on real use, and expand intelligently.\n\n11. Managing Field Services effortlessly\n\nCoordinating field teams, ensuring service quality, and managing logistics in real time is no small task. Without the right tools, inefficiencies pile up – missed appointments, frustrated customers, and escalating cost.\n\nWhy it’s a problem:\n\nScheduling, dispatching, and tracking field teams is complex and prone to errors.\n\nDelays and miscommunication can quickly damage trust and satisfaction.\n\nWithout real-time insights, decision-making is reactive instead of strategic.\n\nHow to win:\n\nCentralize and automate.\n\nSmart scheduling and AI-powered routing reduce inefficiencies.\n\nKeep teams connected.\n\nReal-time communication and mobile access improve service execution.\n\nUse data for smarter decisions.\n\nPredictive insights help optimize operations before problems arise.\n\nPartner with experts.\n\nNear Partner delivers the solutions to take field service management from reactive to proactive.\n\n12. Making the most of what you already have\n\nYou’ve invested in powerful platforms like Salesforce and Microsoft, but are you truly extracting their full value? Too often, businesses underutilize their existing tools, leaving efficiency and growth potential on the table.\n\nWhy it’s a problem:\n\nMany features remain unused, limiting productivity and ROI.\n\nDisconnected tools create inefficiencies and hinder collaboration.\n\nIf teams aren’t fully leveraging the technology, performance suffers.\n\nHow to win:\n\nOptimize configurations.\n\nFine-tune settings and workflows to align with business goals.\n\nEnhance integration.\n\nConnect platforms for seamless data flow and smarter decision-making.\n\nEmpower your teams.\n\nProvide training and support to drive full adoption.\n\n13. Accelerating implementation\n\nWaiting months or years for a custom-built solution is a luxury you can’t afford anymore. Traditional development could be holding your business back, while competitors are using low-code platforms and AI for speeding things up – without sacrificing flexibility or control.\n\nWhy it’s a problem:\n\nCustom solutions often require months, or years, to go live.\n\nBacklogs grow as demand for new applications outpaces resources.\n\nStatic systems can’t keep up with evolving market demands.\n\nHow to win:\n\nLeverage low-code platforms.\n\nBuild and deploy applications quickly with minimal coding.\n\nEmbed AI for smarter automation.\n\nReduce manual work and enhance decision-making.\n\nEmpower non-developers.\n\nGive business teams the tools to create solutions without relying solely on IT.\n\n14. Managing the social impact of AI\n\nAI is not just disrupting technology; it’s trembling the very foundations of society. The rise of automation and AI threatens to wipe out jobs, create ethical nightmares, and erode public trust if not managed correctly. The way you handle AI’s social impact will define your company’s future.\n\nWhy it’s a problem:\n\nAI comes with job displacements. New roles will emerge, but some will vanish. Are you prepared to guide your team through this shift?\n\nAI raises questions about privacy, fairness, and transparency – issues that need your attention now\n\nConsumers are watching closely. They want to know how their data is being used and how AI decisions affect them.\n\nHow to win:\n\nReskill your workforce.\n\nEquip your teams with the skills they need to thrive alongside AI, ensuring they’re part of the solution, not the casualty.\n\nLead with ethics.\n\nEmbrace AI in a way that prioritizes fairness and transparency. Being responsible is essential for building long-term trust.\n\nCommunicate openly.\n\nBe transparent about how AI is shaping your business and how it benefits customers. Lead the conversation and show you’re in control of the change.\n\nA real-world example: how we helped QMC overcome Telecom challenges with Salesforce\n\nQMC is a global leader in telecom with over 2,400 assets, is revolutionizing communication with cutting-edge technologies like 5G, AI, IoT, and virtual reality. Their diverse clients include municipalities, airports, hospitals, and shopping malls. However, even the biggest players in telecom face challenges that can stall growth and impact service delivery.\n\nQMC’s global operations were plagued by disjointed systems. Sales teams struggled to manage leads, proposals, and contracts effectively. Meanwhile, field teams faced difficulties tracking installations and maintenance across various regions. The lack of structure and organization resulted in inefficiencies that directly impacted customer satisfaction and business performance.\n\nWe started by overhauling QMC’s sales process. With\n\nSalesforce\n\nand\n\nSitetracker\n\n, we automated and streamlined everything from customer insights to contract management, ensuring real-time visibility and better decision-making. This shift allowed QMC to handle leads and proposals more efficiently, with data stored in a centralized, organized manner.\n\nNext, we focused on operations. A tailored workflow for task management, reporting, and maintenance tracking improved overall efficiency. The result was better coordination, faster project implementation, and a standardized onboarding process that supported QMC’s rapid growth.\n\nQMC has completely redefined how they operate, transforming from a fragmented system into a powerhouse of efficiency across teams and continents. By centralizing their data, they’ve shattered silos, improved internal communication, and redefined project execution. The payoff? A telecom giant that’s not just keeping up with the demands of a rapidly growing market, but outpacing the competition with agility, scalability, and a laser-focus on customer success.

It analyses data, automates tasks, and delivers real-time insights, to help teams make smarter decisions and drive results.\n\nIdeal for:\n\nSales, service, and operations teams that want to leverage AI for efficiency, automation, and more data-driven decision-making.\n\n3. Prompt Builder: because AI should speak your language\n\nAI is only as powerful as\n\nthe prompts it receives\n\n. Prompt Builder allows businesses to design and refine AI interactions, ensuring that AI-driven responses are accurate, contextual, and aligned with the company’s goals. By fine-tuning prompts, teams can create more natural and meaningful conversations between AI and users.\n\nIdeal for:\n\nMarketing, customer service, and operations teams that want to fine-tune AI-driven conversations to improve engagement and efficiency.\n\n4. Salesforce Data Cloud: your data, unified and weaponized\n\nModern businesses are drowning in data but often struggle to extract real value from it. Salesforce Data Cloud consolidates, structures, and activates data across all sources in real time, transforming raw information into actionable intelligence.\n\nIdeal for:\n\nEnterprises, data-driven organizations, and leaders who need a unified, real-time view of their business to drive strategy and execution.\n\n5. Einstein Analytics: AI-driven business intelligence at your fingertips\n\nTraditional analytics provide data; Einstein Analytics provides answers. It applies advanced AI models to identify patterns, predict trends, and recommend actions.\n\nIdeal for:\n\nExecutives, analysts, and business leaders who need deeper insights to stay ahead of the competition.\n\n6. Einstein Voice: stop typing, start doing\n\nEinstein Voice allows users to interact with Salesforce using natural speech, making it easy to perform tasks like updating records, retrieving information, and executing commands, simply by speaking. Whether you’re in the middle of a meeting, on the go, or hands full in the field, Einstein Voice helps you stay productive without needing to type.\n\nFor example, a sales professional can update a client’s contact information while driving to their next meeting, or a field team can log important notes directly into the system after visiting a client, all without having to stop what they’re doing.

Einstein Bots: chatbots that know what customers want\n\nAutomating customer interactions through\n\nchatbots\n\ndoesn’t mean sacrificing quality. Einstein Bots use AI to engage with customers across multiple channels, answering common inquiries, resolving issues, and seamlessly escalating complex cases to human agents when necessary.\n\nIdeal for:\n\nCustomer service teams, support managers, and businesses that want to scale their customer engagement while maintaining a high-quality service experience.\n\nBest practices for implementing Salesforce AI tools\n\nAI is only as powerful as the way you use it. To get real results, instead of just another layer of tech, follow these best practices when implementing Salesforce AI tools:\n\n1. Start with a clear goal (not just “let’s use AI”)\n\nAI can be a game changer, but it’s important to define a clear objective before jumping in. Whether your goal is improving lead conversion, automating customer support, or refining marketing campaigns, AI should align with your business needs. Remember, AI is a tool, not a strategy.\n\nStart small. Begin with one focused use case, and iterate as you go. This allows your team to become comfortable with the technology and its outputs. As you gain confidence, you can gradually expand its capabilities, adding more functionalities over time. By evolving in this way, you ensure smoother adoption and better results as your AI systems grow.\n\n2. Clean up your data first\n\nAI thrives on quality data. If your CRM is full of duplicates, outdated contacts, or incomplete records, AI won’t magically fix it. Invest time in data hygiene so your AI models can deliver real insights instead of incorrect predictions.\n\n3. Integrate seamlessly\n\nAI works best when it’s connected across your entire Salesforce ecosystem. Ensure your AI tools sync with CRM, marketing, sales, and service platforms to create a\n\nunified, intelligent workflow\n\n.\n\n4. Automate, but keep a human touch\n\nAI is great at handling repetitive tasks, but some interactions still\n\nneed a human element\n\n. Use AI to enhance – not replace – your team, ensuring automation supports meaningful, personalized customer experiences.\n\n5. Train your team\n\nProvide training so teams understand how to interpret AI-driven insights, adjust automation settings, and use AI as a strategic advantage.\n\n6. Monitor, optimize, repeat\n\nTrack performance, refine processes, and tweak AI models as your business evolves. The more you fine-tune, the smarter your AI becomes.\n\nSalesforce AI tools work best when they work with you\n\nYou know AI has the power to transform your business, but where do you start? How do you avoid complex integrations, wasted budgets, and tools that overpromise but underdeliver? That’s where we come in.\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we help businesses\n\nimplement Salesforce\n\nAI tools in a way that actually works. If disconnected data is slowing you down, we unify and activate it. If AI adoption feels overwhelming, we train your teams to use it effectively. And if you’re unsure what tools you actually need, we guide you to the right solutions – the ones that drive real impact, and don’t add complexity.\n\nGet in touch today\n\nand let’s turn AI into a real advantage for your business.",

    "content": "Agentforce lets you build custom AI agents directly in Salesforce using your own data and workflows. Learn how it works, what you can do with it, and how to get started.\n\nAgentforce is a new way to build AI agents directly inside Salesforce, powered by your data, logic, and workflows. Whether you’re looking to automate customer support, streamline sales operations, or personalize experiences at scale, Agentforce makes it easy to bring intelligent automation into your existing CRM setup. In this guide, we’ll show you exactly how it works, what it can do, and how to start building your own agents in just a few steps.\n\nWhat is Agentforce Salesforce?\n\nAgentforce is a\n\nnative Salesforce\n\ntool that allows users to create AI agents directly within the Salesforce platform. These agents can understand prompts, take actions, and automate workflows by interacting with Salesforce data and logic — all without needing to leave the CRM environment. Agentforce is built to work with your existing Salesforce setup, including custom objects, flows, Apex code, and permission settings.\n\nUnlike generic AI chatbots, Agentforce agents are deeply integrated into Salesforce, meaning they can perform context-aware tasks like updating records, generating reports, or triggering automations based on real-time input. You can define what the agent knows, what it can do, and how it should behave, making it a flexible solution for automating support, sales, service, or internal operations.\n\nHere are some of the core features that make it a powerful tool for AI-driven CRM automation:\n\nNative Salesforce Integration:\n\nagents run entirely within Salesforce, with full access to your objects, records, flows, Apex classes, and permissions.\n\nCustomizable Agent Context:\n\ndefine exactly what each agent knows, from knowledge base articles to custom object relationships to ensure relevant, accurate responses.\n\nNatural Language Prompting:\n\nusers interact with agents using simple, conversational prompts, making complex tasks more accessible to non-technical users.\n\nSecure and Permission-Aware:\n\nagents respect Salesforce security models, so actions are limited by the same profiles and permission sets as human users.\n\nAction-Triggered Automation:\n\nagents can call flows, execute Apex code, or update records based on user prompts enabling real-time, AI-powered workflows.\n\nUsage Monitoring and Feedback:\n\nAdmins can review how agents are being used, identify patterns, and refine performance over time with built-in monitoring tools.\n\nBenefits of Agentforce\n\nIn Agentforce, an\n\nagent\n\nis an AI-powered assistant that can understand natural language, take action, and interact with your Salesforce data and processes, all based on the rules and context you define. These agents are not just chatbots; they can perform real tasks like updating records, triggering workflows, answering internal questions, or guiding users through complex processes. Because they run natively in Salesforce, they work seamlessly with your existing objects, automations, and security settings.\n\nThe main benefit of Agentforce is that it brings intelligent automation into your CRM without needing custom code or third-party integrations. You can build agents tailored to your business needs, whether to handle common support requests, assist sales teams, or provide internal help desk functionality. Agents are easy to create, customizable, and context-aware, helping teams save time, reduce errors, and deliver faster, more consistent responses across the board.\n\nLimitations of Agentforce\n\nWhile Agentforce is powerful, it’s not a plug-and-play solution for every use case. Agents rely on well-defined prompts, context, and access to the right Salesforce data to be effective — which means some setup and iteration is required. If your data model is inconsistent or your workflows are complex, agents might struggle to return accurate results without fine-tuning.\n\nAnother limitation is scope. Agentforce agents are designed to operate within the Salesforce ecosystem, so they’re not ideal for tasks that require integration with external tools or systems unless additional development is done. Also, while no-code configuration is a key benefit, building high-performing agents still requires someone who understands how your Salesforce environment works — which may limit adoption for non-technical users without support.\n\nAgentforce: Real-World Applications\n\nBy combining AI with native Salesforce capabilities, Agentforce makes it possible to streamline work in ways that are both intelligent and secure. Here are a few real-world applications:\n\nCustomer Support:\n\nAgents can answer common customer queries, update case records, and route issues to the right team — reducing response times and freeing up human agents for complex problems.\n\nSales Enablement:\n\nSales teams can use agents to summarize account history, update opportunities, log call notes, or even suggest next-best actions, all via natural language prompts.\n\nInternal Help Desk:\n\nEmployees can interact with an internal AI agent to get answers about company policies, submit IT requests, or update HR information — without needing to navigate multiple systems.\n\nMarketing Operations:\n\nAgents can pull campaign performance data, generate reports, or automate common workflows like list segmentation or lead assignment.\n\nField Service & Logistics:\n\nTechnicians or coordinators can use AI agents to check inventory, schedule visits, or log service notes — all on the go, through a prompt-based interface.\n\nHow to get started with Agentforce\n\nGetting started with Agentforce begins inside your Salesforce setup. First, make sure you have access to Agentforce (currently available in select editions or via pilot programs). From there, you can create your first agent directly within Salesforce by defining its\n\npurpose\n\n,\n\ndata access\n\n, and\n\npermissions\n\n. You’ll also set up the\n\ncontext\n\n, which tells the agent what it knows — for example, which objects it can access or what internal documentation it should reference.\n\nOnce your agent is created, you can test it right away using natural language prompts. From there, refine its behavior by configuring which flows, Apex classes, or automations it can trigger. Salesforce provides tools to monitor and adjust how the agent performs over time, so you can continuously improve its usefulness. No additional tools or integrations are needed — everything runs natively within the Salesforce platform.\n\nCustomizing Your Agentforce\n\nOne of Agentforce’s biggest strengths is its flexibility — you can customize agents to align with your specific business logic, processes, and data model. This includes defining what the agent “knows” (such as product info, internal documentation, or customer data), what it can “do” (like trigger flows, update records, or escalate cases), and how it should respond to user prompts. You can also set guardrails to ensure it respects role-based permissions and only takes actions that are secure and compliant with your internal policies.\n\nThat being said, building truly effective agents often requires more than just enabling the feature. To get the most value, companies need to think strategically about prompt engineering, context design, flow integration, and user experience. That’s where working with a specialized Salesforce partner like\n\nNear Partner\n\ncan make a difference. With deep experience in Salesforce architecture, automation, and AI enablement, Near Partner can help tailor Agentforce to your specific needs — from designing smart agent workflows to ensuring they scale with your business.\n\nGet started with Near Partner\n\nAgentforce bridges the gap between Salesforce’s capabilities and your team’s daily reality, ensuring every interaction is backed by real intelligence.

    "content": "If you navigate the complex waters of software development, it is highly likely that you came across terms like outsourcing destinations, offshore and nearshore outsourcing. While images of shores and beaches came to mind, it all sounds confusing when the conversation topic is software… Don’t worry. Help is on the way!\n\nLet’s start from the basics.\n\nIn a nutshell, software development outsourcing is when a business hires a third-party company or developer(s) to handle information technology tasks, like building a solution from scratch or providing an extra pair of hands to their internal development team.\n\nWhat software development outsourcing means today\n\nEven though software development outsourcing has been here for decades, nowadays it is a crucial tactic for any organization who wants to keep up or keep ahead in technology.\n\nNot long ago, organizations used outsourcing to improve back-office operations through cost reduction and performance improvement. Today, outsourcing solutions are enabling competitive advantage by accelerating changes within those organizations that have the audacity and skill to leap over the technology chasm. The focus has shifted from traditional work transfer to upfront transformation and automation! And that is super exciting!\n\nDeloitte 2016 Global Outsourcing Survey\n\nTherefore, businesses are challenging traditional methods of building software and driving a huge competitive advantage!\n\nBut what is the best outsourcing option for your business? Let’s dissect each one of them!\n\nLocation: what distinguishes offshore from nearshore\n\nTypically, software development outsourcing can be described as nearshore or offshore. But what’s the real difference? In practice, it’s the distance between the contractor and the provider:\n\nNearshore Software Developement: outsourcing in countries in the same or similar time zone, located in bordering countries or a short distance away;\n\nOffshore Software Developement: outsourcing: to regions that are overseas or more than four time zones away.\n\nFor example, if you are in the United Kingdom, it would be considered “nearshore outsourcing” any provider located in South, Central and Eastern Europe, such as Portugal, Spain, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Romania, and Poland. Although all these countries are relatively close to you, only Portugal is in the same time zone (which has a major impact on a daily basis).\n\nIndia, on the other hand, is considered an offshore outsourcing destination. With a time difference of almost 6 hours, it is located at more than 4,000 miles away and a flight distance of more than 8 hours.\n\nWhy proximity matters in software development outsourcing\n\nDestinations like India, China and Vietnam were the standard outsourcing countries for more than a decade. However, in the last years, businesses have started to see the benefits of building outsourcing partnerships with nearby countries.\n\nAlthough these low-cost countries have extremely low wages, there is a big misconception that offshore outsourcing is cheap. If you look deeper, you’ll find a pool of hidden cost – management attention, communication, and co-ordination expenses. Not to mention taxes or duties that sometimes might be due. These ventures turn out to be quite expensive.\n\nThat’s why businesses are changing their game plan. Nowadays, geographical and cultural proximity play a crucial role in the outsourcing industry.\n\nSame or similar time zone, shared language, and proximity mean you can fully be in control and involved in your project.\n\nOf course, cost efficiency is one of the major factors as well. But the real price is factored in and seldom does the evaluation include solely the daily rate of the development team.\n\nModesty aside, a great example of\n\na premium value-to-cost ratio is Portugal\n\n. In Portugal you’ll find a pool of talent, prime location, social and political stability, excellent accessibility and great technological infrastructures. Portugal is seriously considered one of the most competitive outsourcing destinations.\n\nCan you Outsource and still be Agile? It’s all about communication\n\nDefinitely. And,\n\nfrom our experience\n\n, it can make or break an entire development project.\n\nIt is common to say that Agile is only suitable for small and co-located teams. However, stats are showing that’s not only the case. The\n\n10th Annual State of Agile Report\n\nshows that 71% of agile teams are geographically distributed in some manner. Moreover, according to\n\n12th Annual State of Agile Report\n\n, 45% of respondents are using agile practices to manage outsourced development projects and 40% of respondents indicated they plan to increase the use of agile in outsourced development projects in the next 24 months.\n\nThese numbers show that Agile\n\ncan and should\n\nbe used in software development outsourcing. The emphasis in mutual trust, communication, collaboration, and flexibility, results in a 98% of success of Agile Projects.\n\nVersionOne 12th Annual State of Agile Report\n\nWe believe that, if you want to find success in your Outsourcing projects, communication is of paramount importance. And that’s why we are bringing out Agile in a post about Outsourcing. The adoption of Agile methodologies makes it easier to avoid misconceptions, misunderstandings and, in general, miscommunication.\n\nIf you want to succeed in Outsourcing, it’s easier if you adopt Agile methodologies. Make sure you’ll find a partner who shares the same vision.\n\nNearshore as a value-added solution\n\nSoftware development Outsourcing is now the new normal. But the latest research shows a shift in industry thinking. Outsourcing is not just about saving money anymore. It’s seen as a critical tool in innovation and automation.\n\nHowever, the biggest challenge for a successful project is managing the communication. Proximity – geographical and cultural -, language, common technologies and shared methodologies, all play an important part when it comes to choosing your outsourcing partner.\n\nWhether you choose a nearshore or offshore outsourcing, the most significant thing is to choose a partner who understands you and with whom you can keep a relationship of trust and team work.\n\nWhat about you? Are you looking to extend your development team?\n\nLet us help!\n\nShare your needs with us\n\n.",

    "content": "Is your AI ready for the ethical reckoning, or are blind spots holding it back? Get to know Ethical AI in practice and how you can make it happen.\n\nAI is making high-stakes decisions in\n\nfinance\n\n,\n\nhealthcare\n\n, law enforcement, and hiring. Yet, biases persist, privacy violations are rampant, and accountability is an afterthought. We need a serious conversation about AI and ethics, one that goes into the uncomfortable truths of responsible artificial intelligence.\n\nIf you’re weaving AI into your business, this should be a concern. Your competitors might cut corners, but the companies that take Ethical AI seriously will be the ones that earn trust, avoid costly failures, and secure long-term success.\n\nWhat is Ethical AI?\n\nEthical AI, ai its core, is about developing systems that are fair, transparent, accountable, privacy-conscious, and aligned with human well-being. However, AI itself does not possess ethics – its creators and deployers do. Ethical AI requires proactive safeguards, rigorous oversight, and a willingness to make trade-offs that may not always align with short-term gains.\n\nA truly ethical AI system integrates fairness considerations from inception. It ensures that decision-making processes are intelligible and challengeable. Most importantly, it recognizes that AI does not exist in a vacuum – its societal impact must be continuously assessed, refined, and governed with long-term responsibility in mind.\n\nUltimately, Ethical AI is a strategic imperative. Organizations that prioritize it will mitigate reputational and regulatory risks and also build trust, longevity, and sustainable value in an AI-driven world.\n\nWhy Ethical AI shouldn’t be an afterthought in your projects\n\nSimply put, without ethical considerations, AI creates new problems, often at an unprecedented scale.\n\nThe cost of ignoring Ethical AI is higher than you think\n\nWhen organizations sideline ethics, they invite trust erosion, lawsuits, and regulatory nightmares. Fixing ethical failures retroactively is far more expensive than integrating responsible AI from the start.\n\nAI mistakes have real-world consequences\n\nA flawed algorithm makes bad predictions, denies loans, misdiagnoses patients, reinforces discrimination, and disrupts lives. When AI gets it wrong, it fails people.\n\nOpaque AI is a ticking time bomb\n\nIf you can’t explain why your AI made a decision, you can’t fix it when things go wrong. Black-box models limit accountability and destroy confidence in AI-driven systems. Transparency is the difference between trust and catastrophe.\n\nAI doesn’t exist in the void\n\nIt mirrors and amplifies societal biases. Ignoring ethical considerations is irresponsible and reckless. If AI isn’t actively designed to mitigate harm, it will inevitably reinforce existing inequalities.\n\nIf your AI isn’t ethical, it isn’t truly intelligent\n\nIntelligence without ethical grounding creates more problems than solutions, turning innovation into a liability. Ethical AI defines whether technology drives progress or deepens societal harm.\n\nEthical AI in practice: how to make it happen\n\nEthical AI requires concrete actions, tough decisions, and a willingness to challenge industry norms. Here’s what needs to happen.\n\n1. Build ethics into the code\n\nEthics must be embedded at every stage of the development process, from data selection to algorithm design and decision-making. This prevents models from reinforcing bias and evading accountability. Without this foundation, ethical concerns will surface only when damage is already done.\n\n2. Verify data quality and question its origins\n\nAI models inherit the biases and blind spots of their training data. To prevent discriminatory outcomes, it’s essential to verify the quality of the data, ensure proper authorization for its use, and critically assess whose perspectives it represents. This step is crucial before the model even starts learning.\n\n3. Choose credible partners for development\n\nCollaborating with trustworthy and ethical partners when developing AI applications is non-negotiable. Partners who prioritize fairness, transparency, and accountability will help safeguard against ethical breaches and technical failures.\n\n4. Test with difficult questions and prepare for failure\n\nEthical AI requires rigorous testing with challenging scenarios and edge cases. This includes preparing for situations where the AI system makes mistakes and implementing mechanisms to catch and correct these errors before they escalate.\n\n5. Ensure explainability, not just accuracy\n\nA model that “works” without anyone understanding\n\nwhy\n\nis a liability. Explainability is a safeguard against unintentional harm. If AI makes a high-stakes decision, people deserve to know the reasoning behind it. Black-box models might impress on paper, but in practice, they erode trust and accountability.\n\n6. Keep humans in the loop\n\nAutomation should enhance human judgment, not replace it. AI without human oversight is a ticking time bomb, especially in areas like healthcare, hiring, and criminal justice. If an AI-driven system can’t be challenged or overridden when it gets things wrong, it has no place making critical decisions.\n\n7. Ensure clear communication about potential errors\n\nMake sure users are informed that the AI system is not infallible and can make mistakes. Provide clear instructions on how to identify potential errors and how to report them. Additionally, offer support channels where users can seek assistance when issues arise. This proactive approach mitigates risk and fosters user confidence.\n\n8. Measure beyond performance and go for impact\n\nLooking at precision, recall, and efficiency is fine, but if you’re not measuring bias, unintended consequences, and real-world effects, you’re missing the point. Ethical AI involves what happens when real people interact with it.\n\n9. Take responsibility, not just credit\n\nWhen AI goes wrong – and it will – who’s accountable? Too often, companies hide behind the complexity of their models when things break down. Ethical AI means owning the consequences, beyond celebrating the successes. If you build it, you’re responsible for it.\n\n10. Remember that Ethical AI is built, not assumed\n\nEthical AI is a continuous process of scrutiny, adjustment, and commitment. The organizations that take this seriously won’t just avoid regulatory backlash – they’ll build AI that people actually trust.\n\nFAQs\n\nHere are straight answers to some of the toughest and most crucial questions about Ethical AI.\n\n1. Can AI ever be truly neutral?\n\nNo. AI reflects the biases of its creators, the data it’s trained on, and the world it operates in. The real question isn’t whether AI can be neutral, but how much bias we’re willing to tolerate, and what we do about it.\n\n2. If my AI follows regulations, does that mean it’s ethical?\n\nNot necessarily. Regulations set the floor, not the ceiling. Most AI laws lag behind technology, so if you’re just “complying,” you might already be behind in ethical standards.\n\n3. Does ethical AI mean sacrificing innovation?\n\nNo, but it does mean rejecting lazy innovation. Cutting ethical corners can make development faster, but only until the lawsuits, backlash, and reputational damage start rolling in. Ethical AI forces companies to innovate better, not just faster.\n\n4. Is it possible to build AI that doesn’t discriminate?\n\nCompletely bias-free AI is a myth, but that doesn’t mean we should stop trying. The key is to minimize harm through diverse datasets, transparent decision-making, and constant monitoring. AI should be questioned, audited, and refined, just like any human decision-making process.\n\n5. If AI makes a bad decision, who’s responsible?\n\nThe company, the developers, the data providers – everyone who contributed to the system. “The AI did it” isn’t an excuse. Ethical AI means owning up to the consequences, not hiding behind automation.\n\n6. Why should businesses care about ethical AI if customers don’t?\n\nCustomers don’t care, until they do. The moment an AI system makes a high-profile mistake (racist hiring algorithms, unfair loan decisions, deepfake scams), public trust evaporates. You wouldn’t want to keep customers happy just today; you’ll want them to trust you tomorrow.\n\n7. How do I know if my AI is actually ethical?\n\nAsk the hard questions: Who benefits from this AI? Who gets left out? If this system fails, who gets hurt? And most importantly, are we prepared to be held accountable? If your answers make you uncomfortable, your AI probably isn’t as ethical as you think.\n\nEthical AI: a challenge worth taking\n\nThe temptation to bypass ethical considerations in AI development is ever-present. It can feel like a quick way to meet deadlines, cut costs, or push innovation. But taking the shortcut now can lead to far more expensive consequences down the road. That being said, a quick and crucial reminder: partner with a team that builds powerful systems grounded in ethical principles.

    "content": "In March 2023, Salesforce announced Einstein GPT as the world’s first ever Generative AI for use within CMR. A few months later, Salesforce announced\n\nEinstein 1, a platform\n\nbuilt upon Einstein GPT. Fast forward to\n\nSalesforce Spring ’24 even and\n\nnow the time has come for Einstein Copilot, an AI assistant embedded directly within the platform, to shine. So, what is exactly Einstein GPT and why is it promising to revolutionise customer relationships across industries?\n\nWhat is Einstein GPT?\n\nEinstein GPT is Salesforce’s large language model (LLM) chatbot. Einstein GPT is integrated with Salesforce Einstein 1, and it is built over OpenAI’s language model – albeit customised with Salesforce’s proprietary data and business expertise.\n\nTrained on massive datasets of text and code, Einstein GPT can generate human-like text, translate languages, create creative content, and answer questions from simple or complex prompts. Furthermore, Einstein GPT can help automate tasks, provide customer support, and\n\npersonalise customer experiences\n\nwithin the CRM platform.\n\nWhat does Einstein GPT include?\n\nEinstein GPT is included in the Einstein 1 environment, and Copilot gives it a user-friendly interface, making it easy and intuitive to use, even for users with little to no\n\nAI experience\n\n. Under the hood, Einstein GPT includes:\n\nA\n\nnatural language processing (NLP) engine\n\nwhich allows the chatbot to process natural language prompts and generate natural language content;\n\nA\n\npowerful API\n\nwhich makes it very simple to integrate Einstein GPT with other systems and across the cloud;\n\nA\n\nmachine learning (ML) engine\n\nwhich allows it to learn from data inputs and adjust its performance;\n\nBuilt-in\n\ntranslating capacities\n\n;\n\nA\n\nknowledge graph\n\nthat stores information about customers, sales, or prices, and helps the chatbot generate more accurate and relevant responses.\n\nWhat is the purpose of Einstein GPT?\n\nAs a part of Salesforce Einstein 1, Einstein GPT helps businesses leverage AI to their benefit, mainly for:\n\nIncreased efficiency and productivity:\n\nEinstein GPT can automate tasks such as generating reports, answering customer questions, and creating marketing copy. This can free up employees to focus on more strategic and creative work.\n\nBespoke customer experiences:\n\nEinstein GPT can improve customer experiences by generating personalised recommendations for products or services and providing tailored customer support.\n\nCreative content generation:\n\nSalesforce’s AI can be used to generate creative content such as blog posts, articles, and social media copy, saving businesses time and money on content creation. With the help of machine learning and sentiment analysis, Einstein GPT can also “read” the brand’s communication style and adapt it to the target public.\n\nSeamless CRM integration:\n\nYou can generate emails, reports, summaries, access and analyse customer data, refine sales pipelines, and automate workflows, without switching between separate systems. This also reduces the opportunity for errors.\n\nValuable data insights for decision makers\n\n: with ML capabilities and an NPL engine, Einstein GPT can pull customer data, communication patterns, and sales info from the CRM in order to produce reports, summaries, or insights in accessible language. These insights can help improve customer segmentation, targeting, or overall CRM effectiveness.\n\nHow to use?\n\nEinstein GPT can be used in a variety of ways. Here are a few examples:\n\nSales\n\n: allows Einstein GPT to amplify the\n\nSales Cloud\n\nby composing sales-related emails, scheduling meetings with clients, preparing scenarios for next steps and interactions down the sales pipeline, leaving you or other employees hands-free to focus on closing deals.\n\nService\n\n: Einstein GPT can generate quick and friendly chat replies for your customers’ queries, attentive follow-up emails, and analyse past case notes to create drafts for new knowledge base articles, which will in turn ensure your knowledge base stays up-to-date and make your reps’ lives easier.\n\nMarketing\n\n: produce targeted email content with product recommendations and offers tailored to your customers’ interests based on their purchase history, landing pages with relevant campaign messaging and visuals, engaging blog and social media posts, among many others time-saving features within the\n\nMarketing Cloud\n\n.\n\nSlack Customer 360\n\n: Einstein GPT can turn your Slack channels into a hub for communication within your teams. Simply ask Einstein GPT and you can have a smart summary about a customer or a sale delivered directly in your Slack workspace in seconds.\n\nDevelopers\n\n: simply describe the functionality you need in a natural language and Einstein GPT will translate it into a working code. It can also clean your code, suggest improvements, find bugs, create documentation and find trouble areas.\n\nIs Einstein GPT secure?\n\nIf you are worried about data security and privacy: we get it. The AI era brings questions and concerns to businesses dealing with sensitive data. And that is exactly where Einstein GPT Trust Layer comes in. Salesforce built this Trust Layer to act as a safety net operating behind the scenes to safeguard your business’ access and control over its data.\n\nFirst, Einstein GPT never stores the data it accesses, like emails, private info, reports, and others. Instead, the Trust Layer employs several different techniques, such as:\n\nSecure Data Retrieval:\n\nto ensure only authorised personnel access sensitive data, the secure data retrieval method uses multi-layered authentication processes and stringent access controls to pull data from Salesforce.\n\nDynamic Grounding:\n\nthis technique is more or less of a fact-checker, in the sense that it compares outputs against real-time information and past data. Dynamic Grounding helps Einstein GPT’s outputs to be grounded in reality – facts – promoting reliable and trustworthy content.\n\nData Masking:\n\nthis technique intentionally obfuscates private info that isn’t strictly necessary for the task at hand, by replacing it with placeholder values. Users can also select what to mask and what to unmask and under which conditions.\n\nZero Retention:\n\ncustomer data is not stored outside of Salesforce nor retained by third-party LLMs for data training. Once Einstein GPT processes your prompt and generates a response, both prompt and response are forgotten.\n\nToxicity Detection\n\n: this feature analyses the content generated by Einstein GPT for offensive or harmful language, proactively detecting toxic outputs.\n\nAudit Trail:\n\neverything that goes through Einstein GPT, prompts, responses, and trust signals, are logged and stored in the Data Cloud making the interactions auditable, monitorable, verifiable, and transparent. This enables the identification of possible issues or biases but also facilitates compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\nCase study: how Blink Payment transformed customer support with Salesforce Einstein\n\nBlink Payment is a fintech company specializing in processing commercial transactions. It acts as a payment gateway for businesses, allowing them to accept card payments online, in person, or over the phone with a debit or credit card. Despite the advanced technology, strong technical team and vast documentation, they still struggled to make customer support intuitive for their customers and their own staff. They would spend countless hours answering repeated questions, or even looking for answers that could be made available online. They also had a hard time piecing together queries in different channels, such as bots and email or social media.\n\nOur initial approach involved migrating their existing code to more flexible low-code solutions using Salesforce Flows. We introduced an advanced Salesforce Einstein bot, seamlessly integrating it with Blink Payment’s customer portal and their WhatsApp support line.

    "content": "Without it, many of the tools and applications we take for granted might never have existed. Discover what is .NET and what you can build with it.\n\n.NET is the out-of-sight backbone of applications loved by millions – which is why it is easy to forget it exists, what it does or why we really need it. But as more businesses come to rely on new apps and portals for mission critical applications, perhaps we should take a closer look at what .Net can do for us, and whether it is still the best choice for your business.\n\nWhat is .NET, really?\n\n.NET is an open-source software development framework created by Microsoft. Very simply, it allows developers to create applications that can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux, all while keeping a clean, unified codebase. Think of it as a toolkit – except this one can make apps for websites, desktop software, mobile apps, and cloud-based solutions. .NET can integrate with countless libraries, tools, and APIs.\n\nWhy should you care about .NET?\n\nIf you’re a business trying to stay ahead in today’s digital world, then you should care about .NET. Why? Because it speeds up the development process while maintaining flexibility. You want scalable solutions that work across platforms? .NET does that. You want to run apps in the cloud, on your desktop, or even on a mobile device? Yep, it gets you covered.\n\nBesides, Microsoft’s constant backing means .NET will keep evolving. What does that mean for you? A future-proof solution. The code you write today won’t be outdated tomorrow.\n\n.NET origin story\n\n.NET was born in the early 2000s as Microsoft’s ambitious answer to the growing demand for versatile and scalable development frameworks. Initially launched as a proprietary platform tied closely to Windows, it aimed to unify developers under a single, powerful umbrella. Over the years, it shed its walled-garden reputation, embraced open-source, and evolved into a cross-platform powerhouse. Today, it’s the backbone of countless applications, spanning industries and devices, proving that even in tech, reinvention is the key to staying relevant.\n\nHow does .NET work\n\nThe Common Language Runtime is the core component of the .NET framework that handles code execution. Every application that runs on .NET goes through CLR. It manages memory, handles exceptions, provides garbage collection (that’s .NET’s fancy way of cleaning up after itself), and optimizes your application to run efficiently.\n\nIt also ensures your application is secure, guaranteeing that only authorized code can execute within the app. .Net also features something called the Class Library, a vast collection of reusable code, pre-built functions, and components that allow you to quickly implement features without reinventing the wheel.\n\nBut the real benefit is that it supports multiple languages. The two heavy-hitters are C# (pronounced C-sharp) and Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET), but also supports F#, a functional\n\nprogramming language\n\n. Each of these languages is designed to do something slightly different, so depending on your project or your team’s expertise, you can choose the one that suits your needs best. And thanks to the open-source version of .NET – .NET Core – you can now write code that runs across multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nThe Potential Risks of .NET\n\nWhile being a powerful and widely used framework, it is not without its risks. Here are a few potential downsides to consider:\n\nDependency on Microsoft\n\n: As a Microsoft product, .NET has historically been tied to the Windows operating system, although .NET Core has made strides in providing cross-platform capabilities. Organizations that rely on .NET for their infrastructure are somewhat dependent on Microsoft’s decisions regarding the framework’s future direction.\n\nLearning Curve\n\n: While .NET is versatile and supports various programming languages, it can be challenging for new developers to pick up, especially those unfamiliar with C# or Visual Basic. The depth of the framework can be intimidating to beginners.\n\nCompatibility Issues\n\n: Although .NET Core has improved compatibility with different operating systems, there may still be occasional compatibility issues, especially when working with legacy .NET applications.\n\nWhat can you build with .NET?\n\nThe better question: what can’t you build with .NET? Here’s a closer look at what you can create with this powerhouse framework.\n\n1. Web applications that wow\n\nFrom dynamic websites to full-blown e-commerce platforms, .NET has what it takes to build web applications that impress users and keep businesses running smoothly. The secret weapon here?\n\nASP.NET Core\n\n, the web development arm of .NET. It’s fast, scalable, and capable of handling everything from small business sites to global, high-traffic platforms.\n\n2. Apps for every platform\n\nNeed a mobile app that works seamlessly on both iOS and Android? Enter\n\n.NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI)\n\n. With a single codebase, you can build stunning native apps for multiple platforms. .NET lets you unify development efforts without sacrificing performance or user experience.\n\nIf your business requires cloud-native apps, microservices, or large-scale systems that can handle thousands (or millions) of users, .NET combined with Microsoft Azure is a game-changer. From\n\nSaaS (Software as a Service)\n\nto\n\nPaaS (Platform as a Service)\n\n, .NET helps you leverage the cloud to build scalable,\n\ncost-efficient solutions\n\n.\n\n3. Enterprise-grade systems that mean business\n\nImagine an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that handles everything from inventory to payroll or a customer relationship management (CRM) platform that scales with your growing user base. With features like seamless integration with third-party tools and built-in security protocols, .NET ensures your enterprise applications are future-proof and reliable.\n\n4. Game development that immerses players\n\n.NET isn’t just for business apps. I can be a solid choice for gaming too. With\n\nUnity\n\n, one of the most popular game engines out there, .NET developers can build stunning 2D, 3D, AR, and VR games. Unity uses C#, making it the perfect gateway for creating immersive experiences – for consoles, mobile devices, or PCs.\n\n5. IoT applications for the connected world\n\nAs devices become smarter and more interconnected, businesses need software that can keep up. .NET makes it easy to build Internet of Things (IoT) applications. We are talking about smart home systems, industrial monitoring tools, or healthcare wearables. It provides the framework to manage and analyse data from connected devices.\n\nCombine it with Azure IoT services, and you’ve got a robust platform to build scalable IoT solutions with real-time insights and analytics.\n\n6. AI and machine learning applications\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nis already a critical tool for businesses looking to innovate. With libraries like\n\nML.NET\n\n, .NET brings machine learning capabilities into the hands of developers.\n\nWant to build a recommendation engine for your e-commerce platform? Need to analyse customer sentiment on social media? Or perhaps you’re looking to integrate AI chatbots into your customer support? With .NET, you can develop smart applications that learn, adapt, and provide valuable insights.\n\nHow to get started with .NET\n\nThinking about diving into .NET for your next project? Good choice. But before you jump headfirst, break it down in a way that makes sense for your business.\n\n1. Define your objectives\n\nWhat do you want to achieve with your application or platform? It could be improving customer experiences, streamlining internal processes, or launching a new digital product. Understanding your goals will guide your approach to .NET.\n\nPro tip:\n\nIf you’re unsure about the scope, work with a partner (like\n\nNear Partner\n\n) to map out your goals and how a .NET solution fits. This saves time and ensures you’re building something meaningful, not just pretty code.\n\n2. Choose the right .NET flavour\n\n.NET offers several flavours depending on what you’re building:\n\nASP.NET Core:\n\nPerfect for web apps and APIs.\n\n.NET MAUI:\n\nFor mobile and cross-platform apps.\n\nWindows Presentation Foundation (WPF):\n\nIdeal for desktop applications.\n\nML.NET:\n\nIf AI or machine learning is part of your vision.\n\nNot sure which one to pick? Think about your audience. Are you targeting mobile users, desktop users, or both? Need something scalable for enterprise systems? A consultancy can help you decide.\n\n3. Assemble your team\n\nYou need a skilled team to bring your vision to life.

It is nothing more than the latest generation of industrial processes that incorporate innovative and oftentimes disruptive technologies and materials.\n\nSource: ScienceDirect\n\nIt is sometimes pointed out as one of the crucial elements of Industry 4.0, or the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and represents a true paradigm shift in manufacturing, where physical and digital technologies converge to create “smart factories” and interconnected production systems.\n\nWhat are the benefits of Advanced Manufacturing vs Traditional Manufacturing?\n\nThere are several reasons why Advanced Manufacturing is changing manufacturing environments:\n\nIncreased Efficiency and Productivity:\n\nAdvanced manufacturing technologies optimise processes, reduce lead times, and minimise waste, leading to higher productivity and cost savings.\n\nEnhanced Product Quality and Consistency:\n\nPrecision control, predictive maintenance, automated quality assurance, and others, result in higher-quality products with improved performance and greater reliability.\n\nMore Customisation:\n\nAdvanced Manufacturing enables rapid prototyping and configurable production lines, allowing businesses to respond quickly to changing market demands.\n\nSustainability:\n\nAdvanced manufacturing techniques can help minimise waste, energy consumption, and carbon emissions.\n\nSupply Chain Resilience:\n\nAdvanced manufacturing technologies reduce dependence on traditional suppliers and geographically concentrated production, help minimising disruptions caused by part shortages or equipment failures, and to respond effectively to natural disasters or geopolitical events.\n\nWorkforce Development:\n\nnew technologies create new opportunities for skill development, training, and career advancement, and allow for new career paths in areas like AI integration, programming, data analysis, and process optimisation.\n\nExamples of Advanced Manufacturing technologies\n\nAdvanced Manufacturing makes use of very widespread group of technologies – let’s call them the usual suspects:\n\nArtificial Intelligence, Machine Learning\n\n, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data Analytics, and Cloud Computing .\n\nWho’s who in Advanced Manufacturing\n\nSource: CB Insights\n\nHowever, there are many other innovative and disruptive technologies continuously improve, optimise, and enhance traditional manufacturing, into the more efficient advanced manufacturing.\n\nAutomation and Robotics\n\nAdvanced Manufacturing uses very advanced automation and robotics to achieve, for example, high-degree precision. These technologies can be used for a variety of tasks from assembly and welding to more precise tasks such as quality inspection.\n\nTesla’s advanced manufacturing facilities\n\nheavily rely on automation and robotics for tasks such as assembly, welding, and quality inspection in their electric vehicle production. Automation allows Tesla to achieve high precision, increase production efficiency, and maintain consistent quality across their vehicles, contributing to their success in the automotive industry.\n\nAdditive manufacturing\n\nAdditive manufacturing, also known as 3-D printing, includes methods like powder-bed laser printing and fused deposition modelling to create three dimensional models via layer deposition from a digital design and using one continuous material. It differs from the traditional subtractive manufacturing, which involves cutting away material from solid blocks of different materials.\n\nGE Aviation utilizes additive manufacturing technologies\n\nto produce complex components for aircraft engines, such as fuel nozzles and turbine blades. Additive manufacturing enables GE to create lightweight, durable parts with intricate designs that are difficult or impossible to achieve using traditional manufacturing methods. This technology enhances engine performance, reduces fuel consumption, and lowers maintenance costs for airlines.\n\nNanotechnology\n\nNanotechnology allows for the manipulation of materials at an atomic or molecular level, which in turn allows for the creation of advanced materials with very specific characteristics. These novel or improved materials can help develop new techniques and methods in advanced manufacturing.\n\nLockheed Martin incorporates nanotechnology\n\ninto the development of for aerospace and defense applications. By manipulating materials at the nanoscale, Lockheed Martin can create lightweight yet strong materials for aircraft, spacecraft, and military equipment. Nanotechnology also enables the production of coatings with special properties, such as stealth capabilities or resistance to corrosion, enhancing the performance and durability of their products.\n\nAdvanced/Composite Materials\n\nAdvanced or composite materials are precise blends of different materials that acquire very specific characteristics, and are used in very specific situations, such as biomaterials, nanomaterials, high-strength alloys, or other composites.\n\nBoeing utilizes advanced composite materials\n\nin the manufacturing of commercial aircraft, including the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. By incorporating composite materials such as carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP), Boeing is able to reduce the weight of aircraft structures while maintaining strength and durability. This results in fuel savings for airlines, increased range, and improved passenger comfort.\n\nLaser Machining and Laser Welding\n\nCutting and welding materials with a highly focused laser allows for increased precision, reduced distortion, remote operations, automation and also allows for the manipulation of a wide range of materials.\n\nTrumpf is a leading manufacturer of laser cutting and welding systems used in various industries including automotive, aerospace, and electronics.

This enables manufacturers to achieve high-quality results with minimal distortion, increased efficiency, and greater flexibility in production processes.\n\nDigital Twin\n\nDigital twin technology enables the creation of a virtual replica or simulation – ergo, a digital twin – of a physical object, process, or system. Digital twins are used for virtual prototyping, design optimisation, remote control and testing, life cycle assessment, and others, even before the physical object even exists.\n\nIn\n\nHealthcare\n\n, digital twin technology can be applied to create virtual replicas of individual patients or specific organs. It allows healthcare professionals to simulate various medical scenarios, such as surgeries or treatment plans, before performing them on the actual patient. By analyzing the digital twin’s data and running simulations, doctors can personalize treatment strategies, optimize surgical procedures, and predict potential outcomes with greater accuracy.\n\nIn\n\nAutomative Industry,\n\nFord utilizes digital twins to design and test new vehicle models virtually before physical prototypes are built. This approach enables Ford to iterate quickly, reduce development costs, and ensure that their vehicles meet safety and performance standards before production begins.\n\nNetwork and IT Integration\n\nConnecting the various components, systems, and processes within a manufacturing environment through digital networks and information technology infrastructures enables real-time communication, and data exchange, as well as coordination throughout all the stages of the manufacturing cycle, providing instant notification when an issue arises.\n\nA use case to this solution would be a manufacturing company implementing network and IT integration to streamline its supply chain operations. By connecting its ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system with suppliers’ systems through digital networks, the company can automate order processing, inventory management, and shipment tracking. This integration improves visibility, communication, and coordination across the supply chain, reducing lead times and inventory holding costs.\n\nOr you can be a multinational corporation who implements network and IT integration to enhance collaboration among its global workforce. By deploying cloud-based collaboration tools, such as video conferencing, document sharing, and project management platforms, employees can seamlessly communicate and collaborate across different offices and time zones. This integration improves productivity, fosters innovation, and strengthens teamwork across the organization.\n\nIIoT\n\nIIoT stands for Industrial Internet of Things, and just like the name suggests is the application of IoT technology to an industrial context. This means a network of interconnected devices, sensors, machines, and systems within industrial environments that communicate and share data to optimise processes.\n\nOne real example is the implementation of an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) system in a factory setting. In this scenario, various machines, sensors, and devices within the manufacturing environment are connected through a digital network. These interconnected devices collect and exchange data in real-time, enabling seamless communication and coordination throughout the production process.\n\nBy leveraging network and IT integration, manufacturers gain insights into their operations, improve decision-making, and enhance overall productivity. This results in reduced costs, improved quality control, and increased competitiveness in the market.\n\nToyota Motor Corporation has implemented network and IT integration extensively in its manufacturing processes. The company uses sensors and data analytics to optimize production lines, improve efficiency, and ensure quality control in its automotive manufacturing plants worldwide. Boeing, the aerospace giant, utilizes network and IT integration in its aircraft manufacturing facilities. The company employs sensors and data analytics to monitor and optimize production processes, ensuring precision and efficiency in the assembly of aircraft components.\n\nSolving Industry Challenges with Diverse Technologies\n\nThe truth is most industries can benefit from Advanced Manufacturing – who doesn’t like manufacturing optimisation, increased efficiency, enhanced product quality, and so on? – but certain industries are currently leading the charge in adopting advanced manufacturing technologies. For example:\n\nAerospace\n\n: uses additive manufacturing for lightweight parts, robotics for precise assembly, composite and advanced materials for durability and strength, laser technologies for high-precision welds, and virtual twin technology for virtual testing of aircrafts before construction.\n\nAutomotive\n\n: this industry uses robotics for welding and painting, automation for efficient assembly lines, AI for design and development, and Big Data analytics for process optimisation.\n\nMedical devices:\n\nthe medical field leverages additive manufacturing to create prosthetics and implants, nanotechnology for innovative devices, or advanced materials for improved biocompatible implants, prosthetics, and devices.\n\nEnergy:\n\nthe energy sector employs advanced robotics for hazardous or\n\nremote tasks\n\nin power plants, additive manufacturing for wind turbine components, AI for power-grid optimisation, and digital twin technology to simulate and optimise operations.\n\nChemicals & Materials:\n\nthis industry relies on automation for precise control of complex processes, on sensor networks for real-time data for monitoring and optimising production, and on Big Data to aid in identifying trends, improving efficiency, and developing new materials.\n\nThere are, of course, a million other ways the many different sectors and industries use – to larger or lesser scale – advanced manufacturing and advanced manufacturing technologies, but we’d be here for eons.

    "content": "Not every sales tool delivers. Most sound great but leave your sales team juggling spreadsheets and guessing which lead might bite next. If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone:\n\nonly 27% of small-business leaders felt their last software purchase was a “Great Match”\n\n– a solution that truly met their needs without any compromises.\n\nIf you’re wondering how to avoid being part of the 73% who don’t hit the mark, we’ve pulled together 6 powerful tools that actually convert – not just in theory, but in practice. Let’s dive in.\n\nAccount-Based Marketing software\n\nAccount-Based Marketing (ABM) is a focused, high-impact strategy. Instead of spreading resources thin across a broad audience, ABM concentrates efforts on a select group of high-value accounts, treating them as individual markets with tailored messaging and strategic engagement. Simply put, it’s about deepening relationships with existing ones, turning top accounts into long-term growth engines.\n\nCompanies with ABM report a\n\nhigher ROI\n\nthan traditional marketing – 45% say it’s somewhat higher, while 36% see a significant increase. Why? Because it’s built for efficiency and results. Rather than chasing volume, ABM focuses on expanding influence within key accounts, creating opportunities for upselling, cross-selling, and sustained revenue growth.\n\nOf course, executing ABM at scale requires more than just good intentions. It demands the right technology.\n\nThat’s where Salesforce comes in\n\n. With its powerful CRM, marketing automation, and AI-driven insights, Salesforce helps businesses pinpoint key accounts, personalize outreach, and track engagement with precision. It keeps marketing and sales on the same page, eliminates guesswork, and makes sure the right message reaches the right people at the right time. If you’re serious about ramping up your sales, ABM software will give your clients the red-carpet treatment.\n\nCustomer Relationship Management software\n\nA\n\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM)\n\nsystem is a fundamental tool that most businesses already rely on one to keep track of every interaction, from the first cold email to the latest product inquiry.\n\nBut the real value isn’t just in having a CRM; it’s in how businesses leverage that data to drive smarter, more effective sales strategies. A well-used CRM helps sales teams stay on top of leads, time follow-ups strategically, and tailor communications to maximize conversion rates.\n\nSalesforce\n\nis a prime example of how a CRM can elevate the sales process. With its vast ecosystem of apps and integrations, Salesforce goes beyond basic lead tracking to offer a fully integrated solution that streamlines every step of the sales journey, from lead generation to closing the deal.\n\nWhat truly sets it apart is its\n\nautomation capabilities\n\n. By automating repetitive tasks and workflows, businesses can free up time to focus on what matters most: building relationships and driving growth. When used to its full potential, a CRM like Salesforce doesn’t just help businesses track interactions – it empowers them to turn every interaction into an opportunity.\n\nSocial media integrator\n\nA social media integrator connects your sales tools directly to platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook. This means no more missing opportunities because a prospect DM’d you on Instagram instead of emailing. Your social media efforts become more streamlined, your leads more visible, and, ultimately, your sales pipeline is that much stronger.\n\nSocial selling has proven to create\n\n45% more opportunities\n\ncompared to traditional sales methods. Considering how simple it is to add a feed, it’s a small change that can yield significant results.\n\nMultipublisher\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles in marketing today is getting your content in front of the right eyes. With so many channels, how can you ensure your message is being amplified across the board? With multipublishers.\n\nThese tools let you publish and manage campaigns across email, social media, and even SMS with a single click, from one\n\ndashboard\n\n. One piece of content, multiple outlets. And, of course, off-the-shelf multipublishers may not always cut it for your business. With platforms like Salesforce or OutSystems, you can design a multipublisher tool that integrates with your existing systems and processes, ensuring your content gets to the right people at the right time.\n\nCustomer portals\n\nSometimes, the best sales strategy is to let the customer do the work. Customer portals give prospects a self-service platform to manage their accounts, track orders, request support, and more – all without having to pick up the phone. It’s the kind of tool that shifts the customer experience from transactional to relational – and reduces reduce the workload on your sales and support teams.\n\nAnd here’s where it gets interesting: you don’t have to settle for generic portal solutions. Build your own customer portal using low-code tools like OutSystems or go all in with custom development. This way, you can design a portal that’s uniquely yours – optimized for your business needs and providing the best possible experience for your clients.\n\nBuild your own tools\n\nOff-the-shelf solutions are great, but maybe the best tool for your business isn’t the one everyone else is using. It’s the one you\n\ncreate\n\nyourself.\n\nSo, instead of fitting your business into someone else’s idea of a solution, rely on our expert team to build software that’s specifically designed for your operations. A custom CRM that adapts to how\n\nyou\n\nsell. A bespoke ABM solution that knows exactly how to target and nurture your key accounts. A unique customer portal that provides your clients with exactly what they need, when they need it.\n\nNear Partner, the right tools to fuel your sales drive\n\nThe power of a true partnership lies in finding someone who becomes an\n\nextension of your team\n\n–who understands your unique needs and challenges and is ready to tailor the right tools for your success.\n\nThat’s where a\n\nNear Partner\n\ncomes in.

    "content": "Agile went from buzzword to keyword in under 10 years. But what lies ahead for\n\none of the most effective project management tools around?\n\nAlmost 25 years ago, the\n\nAgile manifesto revolutionized\n\nIT project management. Initially created for software development endeavours, Agile quickly grew to other business areas and industries.\n\nWhere nearly 70% of IT and the software development and delivery teams use Agile, nearly half of engineering, product, and R&D teams also use it. It then drops to 28% of business operations and 20% of marketing teams which have adopted Agile principles. Engineering/R&D are the fastest growing adopters of Agile, up 16% over 2022.\n\nWhat is the reason behind such growth?\n\nAs workers and companies around the world have concluded, it actually works and continues to provide significant value, such as improved collaboration, better alignment to the business needs and better quality software delivered. For example, Agile is used 71% in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Scrum continues to be the most popular team-level methodology as it is used by 63% of Agile users, where the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) remains the top choice at the enterprise level at 26%.\n\nOrganizations choose Agile mainly to prioritize, deliver and measure customer/business value as well as to accelerate time to market, but also to include digital transformation and increase delivery predictability.\n\nIs Agile at risk?\n\nThe global feeling about Agile seems to fade out as in 2022, 71% of Agile users were either very or somewhat satisfied with Agile in their organizations, but dropped to 59% in 2023. Let’s dig a bit deeper to understand the reasons behind this decrease.\n\nAt this moment in time, it feels like Agile is having difficulty adapting and that the benefits from Agile vary depending on the organization size. In the 17th State of Agile Report, we can learn that, in 2023, “small, nimble organizations continue to report that Agile is a powerful productivity and organizational framework showing obvious benefits, including increased collaboration, improved software quality, and better alignment with the business. Medium-sized and larger companies, however, are less satisfied with what Agile can do for them, see substantive barriers to organization-wide adoption, and are far more likely to embrace a custom software development strategy that incorporates a number of different frameworks including, but not limited to, Agile.” From AI to developer burnout, hybrid work environments and unrelenting demand, change is happening in every organization in every industry.\n\nIt is clear that small companies benefit most from Agile implementation, as “74% of small companies (versus 62% at large companies) said at least 50% of their applications were delivered on time and “with quality,” 71% of their organizations (compared to 53% at large companies) have complete visibility into what’s being developed and delivered across the SDLC and 61% have product managers who can oversee the entire pipeline and measure value to the business (compared with just 43% of large companies).”\n\nAnother difficulty might be felt inside the organization, as business leaders might define the framework in a substantial different way than practitioners use it, and this creates disconnection across the enterprise when scaling Agile adoption.\n\nIt is getting clearer that business teams might highly impede the Agile adoption as a “generalized” resistance to organizational change or “culture clash” is increasingly being felt, as well as because business teams simply don’t understand what Agile is or what it can do, or feel there is not enough training. Adding to that, not enough leadership participation and inadequate management support or sponsorship also explain why Agile adoption is difficult.\n\nHow to resolve this conflict?\n\nTo resolve this conflict, companies should focus on outcomes (\n\ncustomer expectations\n\n) instead of outputs (deliverables), building customer-centric cultures, and clearly defined business value.\n\nFor the organizations understanding the cruciality of providing business value to customers, they choose to prioritize their software development and delivery goals mainly towards customer satisfaction, time to delivery and competitive advantage, as well as market expansion goals and new customer acquisition.\n\nAI in Agile?\n\nAI is revolutionizing our lives and is having a huge impact in the software development world, however we know it will take time to assimilate all the new processes and practices it brings.\n\n“Among Agile adherents, almost 30% of respondents are actively exploring how to best use LLMs and code assistants in their organizations or are actually integrating them into their products or services. Roughly 22% of survey takers acknowledged some AI experimentation in their companies but said there’s no widespread mandate for use at this point, while 17% are in the initial stages of exploring the role AI could play. Just 13% don’t think anyone is using AI in their companies, and 8% said they’ve been explicitly told not to use it at this time.”\n\nWhat is Agile\n\nAgile is a project management and software development methodology that focuses on being flexible, collaborative, and responsive to customer feedback. Its essence is working in short, manageable cycles called iterations or sprints, where you constantly check in with your team and your customers to make sure you’re on the right track. It’s all about being able to respond to changing requirements quickly and continuously delivering high-quality software to your users.\n\nAgile is an iterative approach to work that helps teams deliver value faster and deliver work in small, consumable increments. There exist various\n\nagile\n\nmethodologies, such as Scrum, SAFe\n\n®\n\n, and Extreme Programming.\n\nOrigins of Agile\n\nThe origins of Agile can be traced back to the late 90s when a group of developers realized that traditional project management methods just weren’t cutting it for software development. They were tired of rigid plans that took forever and didn’t allow for any changes along the way. So, in 2001, seventeen of these developers got together at a ski resort in Utah to brainstorm a better way to manage projects.\n\nOver a few days, they hashed out a set of values and principles that emphasized flexibility, collaboration, and delivering small, working pieces of software quickly. This meetup resulted in the Agile Manifesto, a document that laid the groundwork for the Agile methodology we know today.\n\nThe Agile Manifesto\n\nThis manifesto is pretty straightforward. It has four big values:\n\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools:\n\nbasically, this principle prioritizes people and how they communicate over processes and tools. It’s about focusing on teamwork and talking things out.\n\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation:\n\ninstead of spending ages writing documents that no one reads, Agile teams prioritize getting actual software up and running. The idea is to show something that works and improve it from there.\n\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation:\n\nrather than just sticking to what’s written in a contract (or scope), Agile encourages ongoing collaboration with customers. It’s about working together throughout the project, not just at the beginning and end.\n\nResponding to change over following a plan:\n\nplans are great, but things change. Agile is all about being flexible and adapting to new information or changes in the project as they come up.\n\nAgile 12 principles: understanding the core values\n\nThese values were supported by 12 principles, all aimed at helping teams be more effective and responsive.\n\nCustomer satisfaction\n\n: The top priority is to make customers happy by delivering valuable software early and continuously. It’s like giving them little pieces of the puzzle as you go, so they see progress and get value right away.\n\nWelcome change\n\n: Don’t be afraid of changing requirements, even late in the project. Agile embraces change to give customers a competitive edge.\n\nFrequent delivery\n\n: Deliver working software frequently, usually every few weeks to a couple of months. It’s like having regular check-ins where you show what you’ve done and get feedback.\n\nCollaboration\n\n: Developers and businesspeople must work together daily. It’s all about teamwork and making sure everyone’s on the same page.\n\nMotivated teams\n\n: Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.\n\nFace-to-face conversation\n\n: The best way to convey information is through face-to-face conversation. In other words, talk to people directly whenever you can – it’s faster and clearer.\n\nWorking software\n\n: The primary measure of progress is working software. Forget about all the fancy reports and charts; if the software works, you’re making progress.\n\nSustainable development\n\n: Agile processes promote sustainable development. The team should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.\n\nTechnical excellence\n\n: Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. It’s doing things right from the start to avoid headaches later.\n\nSimplicity\n\n: Maximize the amount of work not done. Essentially, keep things simple and don’t overcomplicate. Focus on what’s really necessary.\n\nSelf-organizing teams\n\n: The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. Let your team figure out the best way to work together and solve problems.\n\nReflection and adjustment\n\n: At regular intervals, have your team reflect on how to become more effective. Then, to behavior accordingly\n\nAgile frameworks\n\nAgile frameworks offer different ways to put Agile principles into action, each with its own set of practices and strengths. Choosing the right one for your team can make a big difference in how smoothly your projects run.\n\nScrum: mastering Agile sprints and team roles\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.scrum.org/resources/what-scrum-module\n\nScrum is one of the most widely used Agile frameworks. It breaks projects into manageable chunks called sprints, typically lasting 2-4 weeks. During each sprint, the team works on a set of prioritized tasks from a product backlog. Scrum emphasizes roles like the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team, and includes regular meetings such as daily standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives.\n\nWhen to use:\n\nIf your project benefits from a structured approach with clear roles and frequent progress checks, Scrum might be a great fit.\n\nKanban, for managing workflow\n\nSource: Wikimedia\n\nKanban focuses on visualizing work and managing flow. It uses a Kanban board to track tasks through various stages, from “To Do” to “Done,” and emphasizes limiting work in progress (WIP) to prevent bottlenecks. Kanban is flexible and allows for continuous delivery, making it ideal for teams needing to manage ongoing work or those with varying priorities.\n\nWhen to use:\n\nIf you’re looking for a method that’s less about fixed iterations and more about maintaining a steady flow, Kanban could be the way to go.\n\nExtreme Programming (XP), for technical excellence\n\n[Source: LinkedIn]\n\nExtreme Programming, or XP, is all about technical excellence and frequent releases. It includes practices like test-driven development (TDD), pair programming, and continuous integration. XP aims to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing requirements.\n\nWhen to use\n\n: If your project requires strong technical practices and frequent feedback loops to refine the product.\n\nLean Software Development, maximizing value and eliminating waste\n\nSource: European Business Review\n\nLean Software Development borrows principles from Lean manufacturing, focusing on eliminating waste and maximizing value. It values practices like optimizing the workflow, delivering in small batches, and empowering teams to make decisions.\n\nWhen to use:\n\nIf your goal is to enhance efficiency and deliver high value quickly, Lean could be the framework to consider.\n\nSAFe (Scaled Agile Framework), for large organizations\n\nSource: Maya Jaber\n\nSAFe is designed to scale Agile practices across large organizations. It provides a structured approach to coordinate multiple teams and align their efforts with organizational goals. SAFe integrates Agile with Lean and product development flow principles.\n\nWhen to use:\n\nIf you’re working in a large organization with multiple teams and need a framework that supports coordination and alignment at scale, SAFe might be the right choice.\n\nHow to make Agile work\n\nMany teams struggle to transition from traditional methods to Agile. However, by following these key practices, they can make the shift effectively and thrive with structure.\n\nStart with a clear vision and goals: t\n\no get Agile working smoothly for your team, begin by defining a clear vision and goals for the project. You need to know where you’re headed and what success looks like to keep everyone on the same page.\n\nPick your Agile Framework: t\n\nhe next step is deciding which Agile framework to use. Keep these factors in mind.\n\nProject size and complexity: f\n\nor smaller teams or simpler projects, Scrum or Kanban might be sufficient. For larger projects or organizations, frameworks like SAFe can provide the structure needed for scaling.\n\nTeam dynamics:\n\nevaluate your team’s size, experience, and preference. Teams comfortable with iterative work and clear roles may thrive with Scrum, while those needing flexibility might prefer Kanban.\n\nTechnical requirements:\n\nif your project demands rigorous technical practices, XP could be beneficial. For continuous delivery and efficiency, Lean might be the best fit.\n\nFlexibility: s\n\nome frameworks offer more flexibility than others. Kanban, for example, is less prescriptive and can be adapted easily compared to Scrum’s structured approach.\n\nBuild cross-functional teams:\n\nassemble teams that bring a diverse mix of skills and expertise to the table. Encourage collaboration and make sure everyone shares their knowledge openly to maximize the team’s effectiveness.\n\nAdopt iterative development:\n\nembrace iterative development by breaking the project into smaller, manageable portions, typically lasting 2-4 weeks. Each iteration should produce a working piece of the product, allowing you to gather feedback and make improvements as you go.\n\nPrioritize customer feedback:\n\nmake customer feedback a priority by engaging with your customers and stakeholders regularly. Continuous feedback ensures that the product aligns with what the customers actually need.\n\nMaintain a product backlog:\n\nkeep a product backlog that lists all the tasks and features you need to work on, prioritized by what’s most important. This acts as your project’s to-do list. Regularly review and refine the backlog to reflect changes in priorities or new insights.\n\nHold regular meetings:\n\norganize regular meetings to keep everyone aligned. Daily standups are great for quick updates on progress, roadblocks, and plans for the day. Sprint planning meetings help you decide what to tackle in the upcoming sprint, while sprint reviews are your chance to showcase what you’ve accomplished and gather feedback. Don’t forget\n\nsprint retrospectives\n\n, where you review what went well and what could be improved to tweak your approach for the next round.\n\nPromote transparent communication:\n\nkeep communication open and transparent. Use tools and practices that support clear information sharing among team members.\n\nFoster a collaborative culture:\n\ncreate a collaborative culture where teams feel empowered to make decisions and solve problems on their own. Encourage innovation and be open to experimenting with new ideas. A supportive environment helps team members feel more engaged and invested in their work.\n\nEmphasize technical excellence:\n\nprioritize technical excellence by adopting best practices like coding standards, automated testing, and continuous integration. Regularly refactor code to keep it clean and adaptable. This ensures that your software remains high-quality and can evolve smoothly over time.\n\nManage change effectively:\n\nbe prepared to handle changes effectively; agile thrives on adaptability, so be ready to adjust to shifts in requirements or market conditions; communicate any changes clearly to minimize disruption and keep the team on track.\n\nMeasure and track progresso:\n\nuse metrics like velocity, burn-down charts, and cycle time to keep an eye on progress and team performance. These metrics help you gauge how well the project is going and identify any areas that need attention. Use the data to make informed decisions and adjust your practices as needed.\n\nInvest in training and development:\n\ninvest in training and development to keep your team up-to-date with Agile practices and tools. Provide opportunities for learning and offer mentorship and support to help everyone grow and adapt. Continuous learning ensures that the team remains skilled and effective.\n\nWhat is “business value” and how can agile improve it?\n\nBusiness Value can mean a lot of different things for different people and companies. For some, creating business value is about quantifiable metrics, such as increasing revenue, cost savings, market share, or shareholder value. For others, it’s about reputation, brand image, social responsibility or sustainability. Whatever it is, Agile can help you achieve it by aligning product development with organizational goals, customer needs, and market trends. Here’s how.\n\nProfitability and cost efficiency\n\nMany Product Owners struggle to track the financial impact of their work on the company’s bottom line. Agile promotes empirical decision-making and evidence-based management, helping you make informed financial decisions. For instance, Product backlog, a key features of Agile, encourages teams to prioritize features that provide clear value, ensuring that development efforts are focused on impactful tasks.\n\nBusiness agility and strategic adaptation\n\nBusiness value is closely linked to an organization’s ability to make fast decisions based on customer feedback and market changes. Agile enhances business agility by empowering Product Owners to iterate on strategies and pivot when necessary. Take sprint planning, another key features of Agile; it encourages clear objectives and prioritizing high-value items for the company. So does Incremental delivery, another of Agile’s principles, that focus on delivering working software in short iterations. This allows for continuous feedback, reducing the risk of wasteful development.\n\nBalancing business and customer value\n\nDelivering value is not just about financial returns – it involves meeting customer expectations. While revenue-driven product goals are essential, focusing solely on profits can lead to poor product-market fit. The Agile methodology encourages a balanced approach, where customer satisfaction translates into long-term business success. Agile’s Retrospectives are regular reviews that help teams identify areas for improvement, fostering innovation and efficiency, thus promoting this delicate balance between business and customer value.\n\nWhat about the future?\n\nThere is little doubt that it is currently one of the most effective project management frameworks around. It is, however, not impervious to change.\n\nIn the next few years, we are likely to see Agile project management shift towards even greater customer collaboration, with organizations involving customers and stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle to gather feedback and refine requirements in real-time. This customer-centric approach ensures that the final product meets the evolving needs and expectations of the end-users.\n\nAgile methodologies are also increasingly\n\nincorporating DevOps practices\n\n, which enable continuous integration, delivery, and deployment of software. This integration allows for seamless collaboration between development and operations teams and improved overall efficiency and quality throughout the software development lifecycle.\n\nThere is a third avenue for growth, as the methodology evolves to address the challenges of scaling to larger projects and organizations. Various frameworks such as Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD), and\n\nLarge-Scale Scrum\n\n(LeSS) have emerged to provide guidance on scaling Agile, allowing organizations to coordinate and align multiple Agile teams working on interconnected projects.\n\nThese changes empower organizations to deliver value to customers faster, adapt to changing requirements more effectively, and improve overall project success rates. Still, culture plays a decisive role. To truly solve problems and be ready for quick shifts, you must first understand the culture and mindset behind this methodology. The practices behind Agile are just the system that sustains and supports agility in the long run.\n\nHow does Near Partner remain agile over time?\n\nFor all its advantages, many companies still face challenges in Agile adoption. Key pitfalls include unengaged leadership, unclear priorities, or just simply not understanding what it does (also reticence to change / closed mindset). The change in an organization needs to start from the top, and leadership needs to be the guiding light of that change.\n\nOrganization coaching, by giving internal training, is a great way to get your employees and organization more familiar and comfortable with Agile vocabulary and methodologies across all departments. At Near Partner, between May and September 2023, our 2 certified Scrum Masters (PSM I), Laetitia and Nelson, gave internal training to all our employees, from developers to marketing and sales departments, about Agile methodologies, more specifically Scrum and Kanban – which are the most used in our projects.\n\nLaetitia and Nelson facilitating Agile training\n\nCore concepts about Scrum – like Scrum foundations, values, team roles and ceremonies – and Kanban principles were presented during this training. Interactive group exercises enabled our Partners to confront their ideas and consolidate their knowledge and were highly liked. Sharing real-life project scenarios and explaining the topics from the basics helped everyone, especially those who have never been in contact with Scrum, to be on the same level at the end of the training.\n\nThe feedback collected was really positive as 96% of the respondents learned something new and 80% rated the session as useful, being able to apply the concepts they learned in their project or to enhance their way of working.\n\nIs your organization ready to take the next step? At Near Partner, our teams undergo regular Agile training to be able to adapt and incorporate the latest changes in the methodology.\n\nGet in touch with Near Partner and let us figure out how we can help your business\n\n.",

    "content": "We put the new GitHub Copilot to the test. Here are the\n\npros and cons and whether it is the right fit for your project.\n\nGitHub Copilot is one of the latest AI coding assistants promising jaw dropping apps in record time. We put it to the test with a simple task (or prompt): create a web app to manage shared office desks. Here’s what we learned along the way.\n\nWhat is GitHub Copilot?\n\nGitHub Copilot is an\n\nAI assistant\n\n, powered by OpenAI’s Codex model. It integrates directly into your development environment (mainly through a Visual Studio Code extension) and suggests code based on the context of your project.\n\nWhat makes Copilot stand out is that it understands your code and helps you write it in real time. As you type, Copilot predicts what you might need next, from simple syntax fixes to more complex functions. It’s like having multiple tools combined into one: it acts as an autocomplete, provides auto-commenting for your code, generates tests, suggests fixes for errors, and, of course, serves as an intelligent AI assistant ready to lend a hand at just the right moment. Why did we choose GitHub Copilot over other AI assistants?\n\nThere are a lot of AI coding assistants out there, but GitHub Copilot has a few features that stand out:\n\nIt’s backed by GitHub\n\n, one of the most trusted names in the coding world.\n\nThe integration with Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is seamless.\n\nIt feels like Copilot was made to live right there with your code, making it incredibly easy to use and add suggestions as you go.\n\nIt saves a lot of time and reduces mistakes,\n\nhelping you focus on writing better code faster.\n\nIt’s affordable,\n\nwith one of the lowest price points on the market, and even offers a free trial to get started.\n\nWe chose GitHub Copilot because it’s reliable, integrates effortlessly, and delivers great performance without breaking the bank.\n\nBuilding a web app at the speed of light with GitHub Copilot\n\nWe wanted to see how quickly we could go from idea to reality, all while keeping it functional, sleek, and ready to deploy. The goal? Build a simple web app for managing office desks at lightning speed and host it using GitHub Azure services.\n\nThe app needed to display a list of desks, make them selectable, and be user-friendly. Nothing too crazy, but we wanted to get the essentials down without spending hours tweaking every little detail. We needed something that worked – and worked fast – without sacrificing quality. Armed with a detailed prompt, we jumped in.\n\nOur first request was straightforward: generate a backend with Django and a frontend with React. It generated a basic (but functional) list, exactly as requested. A far cry from the polished app we had in mind, but definitely a solid starting point.\n\nFrom here, we took a hands-on approach – analyzing each piece of code Copilot generated, checking for quality, and fine-tuning things as we went. If something wasn’t quite right, we would tweak the prompt and ask for a revision. We kept things moving quickly, making small, manageable changes one at a time, and seeing how Copilot responded to each new request.\n\nWhile Copilot is excellent at churning out backend code and handling the heavy lifting, it still struggles when it comes to the more nuanced aspects of UI/UX. For example, we asked it to display items in a clean, responsive layout, with some extra flair – like swapping text for icons or arranging items in neat rows. While the results were functional, they lacked the polish and attention to detail we were looking for.\n\nThis is where the developer’s role became critical. Copilot did an amazing job getting us started, speeding up the process, and providing the foundation we needed. But the real magic happened when we stepped in to refine the app, focusing on usability, aesthetics, and those finishing touches that make a product truly stand out. Copilot accelerated our workflow, but it was the human intervention that turned a functional prototype into something we’re truly proud of.\n\nThe good: what GitHub Copilot did right\n\nCopilot delivered in these key areas.\n\nDetailed responses\n\n: GitHub Copilot didn’t just provide the code, it explained it. Step-by-step breakdowns, making it easier to understand the logic behind the code.\n\nCopy-paste magic\n\n: Integrating generated code into your project is absurdly easy. Just click, and it’s in there. No missed lines.\n\nRapid development\n\n: From concept to functional app in under 30 minutes? Yes, please. GitHub Copilot was like our fast-track ticket to a working web app.\n\nSQL genius\n\n: Ask it to generate a SQL script to populate a test database, and you won’t need to lift a finger. It just works.\n\nThe not-so good: GitHub Copilot’s flaws\n\nAs much as GitHub Copilot impressed us, there were definitely a few rough edges that we couldn’t ignore.\n\nHandling complex prompts\n\n: When the prompt gets too long or complicated, GitHub Copilot can get a little lost. It sometimes misses parts of the requirement and gives partial answers.\n\nMemory lapses\n\n: This is where things get quirky. GitHub Copilot’s memory doesn’t always stick. Tell it something didn’t work, and it might just repeat the same answer like it never heard you. It also forgets context after a while, which can be… frustrating.\n\nVerdict: would we use it again?\n\nYes, absolutely. But with a caveat. GitHub Copilot is not a replacement for a developer. It’s a tool, not a mind. It excels at reducing the grunt work – generating boilerplate code, refactoring, and handling those wearying details you’d rather not waste time on.\n\nThat said, there are still some areas for improvement – namely, handling more complex prompts, improving memory retention, and refining its approach to UI/UX tasks. But given the progress we’ve seen, we’re confident that future iterations will only get better. So, it’s still a work in progress. A very capable work in progress.\n\nAnd if you’re looking to accelerate your development process, solve complex problems, or just want a reliable partner to\n\nbring your ideas to life\n\n, let’s talk.\n\nNear Partner\n\nhas the tools, experience, and innovative mindset to turn your insights into execution.\n\nReach out\n\n, and see what we can create when we work as a team.",

    "content": "are, why they matter and if your business needs one.\n\nSubject to spontaneous outbursts of geek speech!\n\nEvery programmer that has worked in projects that cover more than one geographic location, and where the time displayed to the user is important, has felt the pain of working with multi time zone. In Outsystems it is no different.\n\nFortunately, as the saying goes “there’s an app for that”, or in our case “there’s a Forge component for that”.\n\nDiscover\n\nwhat multi-time zone applications are, why they matter and if your business needs one.\n\nWhat are multi time zone applications?\n\nMulti-time zone applications are apps that cater to users spread across different time zones. These apps need to ensure that time-sensitive features, like scheduling, notifications, or live updates, work seamlessly regardless of where the user is located.\n\nFor example, imagine you’re building an app that allows people to book appointments, join virtual meetings, or receive alerts. If you have users in New York, London, and Tokyo, the app needs to adapt automatically to show the correct local times for each user. A meeting scheduled for 3 PM in New York shouldn’t appear as 3 PM for someone in London – it should show up as 8 PM local time for them, and the following morning for users in Tokyo. Essentially, multi time zone applications adapt to global time differences to offer a steady experience for users everywhere.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nIn a world with remote work, global teams, and international clients, your app needs to meet the demands of users everywhere.\n\nEnsuring a steady user experience\n\nUsers expect your app to work flawlessly, regardless of where they are. Whether they’re using your app to set reminders, track deliveries, or manage personal tasks, they don’t want to worry about time differences. If your app adjusts to their local time zone, it creates a hassle-free experience.\n\nAvoiding costly errors\n\nFor businesses, mistakes related to time zones can lead to more than just confusion. A missed deadline or a late notification could cause major disruptions, financial losses, or reputational damage – for example, in coordinating global shipping or notifying customers about time-sensitive sales. Accurate time zone management prevents costly errors and ensures that everything runs like clockwork.\n\nEnhancing real-time collaboration\n\nMany apps today rely on real-time interactions, from gaming to messaging to team collaboration tools. Multi-time zone management ensures that these features work properly across the globe, allowing users to engage with each other without barriers. Users can work together, share updates or enjoy live content without a hitch, no matter the time zone.\n\nScaling for global growth\n\nAs your app grows, so will its user base. At some point, you’re likely to attract users from different parts of the world. Having multi-time zone functionality built in from the start ensures your app is ready for global expansion. It saves you from having to make complex adjustments later and sets your platform up for success on a larger scale.\n\nSupporting legal and regulatory compliance\n\nCertain industries, like finance, healthcare, and logistics, have strict regulations that vary by region. Ensuring accurate time zone handling can be crucial for compliance, as businesses need precise timestamps for financial transactions, medical records, or contract deadlines. Mistakes in time tracking could lead to legal complications, and robust time zone support helps your app stay compliant across different countries and industries.\n\nTime\n\nZone component actions\n\nFor\n\ntraditional\n\napplications we can use the timezone component avaliable on the Forge.\n\nWith this component you can do several actions including the important:\n\nGetCurrentTimeZone\n\n– returns a TimeZone record containing the current time zone details of the system where the app is running.\n\nThis time zone record is composed by:\n\nIdentifier\n\n– unique identifier for the time zone (ex: UTC, India Standard Time, etc.)\n\nStandardName\n\n– Standard name for the time zone (ex: UTC, India Standard Time, etc.)\n\nDisplayName\n\n– Display name for the time zone (ex: (UTC+05:30) Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, New Delhi)\n\nUtcOffset\n\n– Offset in minutes from the UTC time zone to this time zone (ex: for India Standard Time is plus 330 minutes from UTC)\n\nSupportsDaylightSaving\n\n– True if the time zone supports daylight savings, false if not\n\nIsDaylightSaving\n\n– True if the time zone is currently in daylight savings, false if not\n\nWith this component you can also get the time zone by location (Lisbon, Paris, etc.), by Windows/java identifier or by\n\nIANA code\n\n.\n\nYou can use\n\nConvertFromTimeZone\n\nto convert between two time zones,\n\nConvertFromUTC\n\nto convert from the UTC time zone to another one and\n\nConvertToUTC\n\nto convert to the UTC time zone.\n\nWhen you are dealing with different time zones you should keep the necessary datetimes in your database in the UTC time zone so it’s easier to convert them to the user Time zone using the\n\nConvertFromUTC\n\nand the\n\nConvertToUTC\n\nactions.\n\nWith this component it is easy to get the server time zone using the action\n\nGetCurrentTimeZone\n\n. What if I need the user’s time zone? That is the real problem for which Outystems doesn’t give us an easy solution. So we need to resort to javascript.\n\nGetting the user’s time zone\n\nThere isn’t a definitive way to get the correct time zone of the user’s browser. The best option would be to let the users define their own time zone and then convert the server times using the actions available in the Time Zone component. However, if you really need to be able to detect the user’s browser time zone there is no other way but JavaScript.\n\nEven with JavaScript there is an easy way and a hard way. The first one returns correct values for the time zone but isn’t supported in all browsers (I’m looking at you IE 11).  The second one (and in my opinion quite inefficient) will get you the current UTC offset but may not be able to return the exact time zone location the user is in. As you can see, both options are valid but each one comes with a catch. Depending on your project requirements, you need to pick the one that is a better fit for your situation.\n\nEasy way – Internationalization API\n\nThe\n\nIntl object\n\nprovides a series of tools for language sensitive string comparison, number formatting, and date and time formatting. For the task in hand we will be using this expression:\n\nIntl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone\n\nThis expression, in supported browsers, will return the standard IANA name for the time zone. With this name you can use the action\n\nGetIANATimeZone\n\nfrom time zone component to get the correct time zone record for that time name.\n\nHard way – offset from UTC\n\nWhen the easy way doesn’t work and is enough to know the offset between the user’s browser time zone and UTC, you only need:\n\nnew Date().getTimezoneOffset()\n\nThis will return the difference in minutes between UTC time and the browser’s time. Note that if the times we need to change are in UTC and we need to change them to the user’s time it’s simple math. But if we need more details about the user’s time zone, we‘ll have to make an educated guess using that offset. A simple way of doing this is to get all the system time zones with the\n\nGetSystemTimeZones\n\naction and cycle through them until finding one with the correct offset. Unfortunately, this will most likely not get the correct time zone but the first one with that offset.\n\nImplementation\n\nFor testing the functionalities of the TimeZone component and how to get the user’s time zone we created a page to test the functionalities described below:\n\nIn the first line we have the server time and time zone. In the second one, the server time converted to UTC. At last, the client time and time zone info.\n\nServer time and time in UTC are done in preparation. We get the server time zone with\n\ngetCurrentTimeZone\n\nand then we feed the server time and the server time zone identifier to\n\nConvertToUTC\n\nto get the converted datetime.\n\nFor the user time zone if we don’t have it already before entering the page, we can only get it after the page is loaded. The logic for getting the user time zone is encapsulated in a webblock that returns the user time zone to the parent page.\n\nIn this webblock we kept the script that handles the necessary javascript, an input to keep the values returned by the javascript and 2 buttons: one for when we can get the IANA name and one for when we must get it by the offset.\n\nThe Script\n\nDownload the script here!\n\nButton IANA\n\nIf we have the IANA name we just need to use the\n\nGetIANATimeZone\n\naction and the trigger the\n\nReturnTimezone\n\nevent (Yay for outsystems 11, but if can’t use it, use the old notify to return the values that you need) that returns the timezone record to the parent.\n\nButton Offset\n\nBy offset, as mentioned before, is just inefficient. You’ll most likely not get the correct time zone, but you will have the correct offset to do your calculations. We get the systems time zones and then iterate trough them until we find one with the same offset and then return the timezone using the ReturnTimezone event.\n\nIn the parent screen, we create a handler for the\n\nreturnTimezone\n\nevent that will do the necessary conversions and refresh the necessary parts of the screen that will now display the correct information.\n\nAs you can see the change will not be immediate. There will be a few seconds before the event is triggered and you can display the correct times. This can be solved by using this logic on an entry screen and keeping the necessary info about the time zone in session variables so when you enter another screen you can already do the necessary conversions before the page is loaded.\n\nConclusion\n\nConverting times between time zones isn’t difficult. We already have existing components that do the job for us.\n\nKeep the date times in your database in UTC so it’s easier to convert to any time zone you’ll want in the future.\n\nRegarding the time zone of the user, it’s easier if you know it beforehand (let the user define it). But, let’s face it, normally this isn’t possible. That’s why we need to implement one of these options. Your job is to understand which one is better to solve your problem!\n\nOutsystems Reactive multi time zone applications\n\nFor Reactive applications, the time zone presented to the user is always the time zone of the browser, so we do not need to worry about what time zone is displayed for the user.\n\nNear Parter, your expert in multi time zone applications\n\nEnsuring your app performs flawlessly across time zones is essential for a global audience. With the right development partner, you can deliver a steady, user-friendly experience no matter where your users are.\n\nReady to take your app global?

    "content": "Most companies struggle to reinforce their development team at market speed and with the right skill set. That’s where an extended team comes in.\n\nPicture this: you need some help for your development department. Coders are struggling with the amount of work they’re assigned. Programmers type as hard as they can. And coffee mugs just pile up in the sink. Creating a\n\ncoding dream team\n\nright off the bat is difficult. This is where extended teams come into play.\n\nWhat is an extended team?\n\nAn extended team is an extra pair of hands for your in-house team.\n\nThe extended team model is a form of outsourcing that involves closer proximity, communication, and cooperation between the in-house team and the outsourced team.\n\nSource:\n\nAgile Insider\n\nInstead of having a totally separate team on a certain project(s), companies\n\nreinforce their in-house team\n\n, while maintaining total control over the project and having staff involved in all aspects.\n\nBut an extended team is only one modality of the ETM, or Extended Team Model. There are several kinds of collaboration.\n\nWhat are the key benefits of the extended team model?\n\nThe extended team model presents several benefits for businesses looking to expand their talent pool at speed\n\nYou’re always in the loop\n\nThe extended team model is designed for collaboration. Regular updates, shared progress reports, and\n\nintegrated workflows\n\nmean you’re never in the dark. This approach ensures that the external team doesn’t feel like a separate entity but rather an embedded extension of your core operations. Over time, your in-house team absorbs these practices and skills, becoming stronger and more self-sufficient.\n\nYour priorities = their priorities\n\nUnlike some\n\noutsourcing models\n\nthat juggle multiple clients and projects, the extended team model offers singular focus. Your business objectives are their roadmap, and your success is their benchmark. This alignment ensures that tasks, goals, and timelines are treated with the same level of care and commitment as if they were managed internally. It’s a partnership built on shared priorities and clear outcomes.\n\nAccess to global talent\n\nTalent knows no borders, and neither should your business. The extended team model connects you to highly skilled professionals from around the globe without the logistics of relocation or hiring locally in competitive markets. This diversity brings fresh energy and innovation to your projects, giving your business a competitive edge.\n\nSave serious time\n\nHiring the right people takes time, especially in competitive industries. Screening resumes, scheduling interviews, and onboarding can drag on for weeks – or months. The extended team model bypasses all that. Your external team is ready to jump in, equipped with the skills and experience needed for the job. This means projects start sooner, and you can stay ahead of tight deadlines.\n\nScaling becomes easier\n\nThe extended team model offers the flexibility to scale up when you’re tackling large projects or scale down during quieter periods. This agility allows you to respond to market changes without the risks and costs of permanent staff adjustments. It’s a model designed to grow – or shrink – on your terms.\n\nCost-effectiveness without cutting corners\n\nTraditional in-house hiring comes with hefty costs: salaries, benefits, equipment, and office space. With an external team, you pay for expertise and results, not overheads. You gain access to top-tier talent and state-of-the-art tools without the long-term financial commitments, letting you allocate resources where they’re needed most.\n\nRound-the-clock productivity\n\nWhile your team wraps up for the day, your extended team in another part of the world is just getting started. This continuous workflow ensures progress never stalls, projects move faster, and deadlines are easier to meet. It’s like having your business running 24/7 without the burnout.\n\nSpecialized skills on demand\n\nEvery project has its unique demands, and finding specialists for short-term needs can be a struggle. The extended team model offers a ready-made pool of niche talent without the commitment of full-time hiring. These experts step in when you need them and step out when the project is done, ensuring you get top-tier skills on demand.\n\nFresh perspectives\n\nBringing in an external team means new ways of thinking and working. Extended teams come with diverse experiences and backgrounds, offering solutions you might not have considered. They’re not weighed down by internal politics or “the way we’ve always done it,” so they can spot opportunities and inefficiencies that your team might overlook.\n\nFocus on core business\n\nWhen the technical details and heavy lifting are handled by an external team, your in-house staff is free to focus on strategy and growth. They can dedicate their time to refining products, improving customer experiences, and exploring new markets – essentially, the activities that drive your business forward. It’s a smarter way to allocate resources and energy.\n\nHow does an extended team work?\n\nThe concept of an extended team is simple: it acts as a direct extension of your existing team, where everyone works together towards the same goals. Here’s how it works.\n\nAssess your needs\n\nWe start by identifying the specific skills, roles, or expertise your project requires – the size of the team you need, the scope of the work, and the expected timeline.\n\nDefine the team structure\n\nThen, we outline the team structure, including specific roles (e.g., developers, analysts, designers), experience levels, and technical or cultural fit criteria.\n\nOnboarding the extended team\n\nOnce you have the right people,\n\nit’s time to onboard them\n\n.\n\nIntroduction to your business\n\n: Provide the new team with an overview of your company, its mission, and how their role contributes to your goals.\n\nSet up communication tools\n\n: Integrate the team into your existing communication platforms (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) and\n\nproject management\n\ntools (e.g., Jira, Trello).\n\nExplain workflows\n\n: Share details about your processes, reporting structure, and decision-making protocols.\n\nAssign a point of contact\n\n: Designate a manager or team member as the primary liaison to streamline communication and address questions.\n\nKick-off meeting\n\n: Host an initial meeting to align expectations, clarify objectives, and set the tone for collaboration.\n\nDay-to-day collaboration\n\nThe extended team is ready to become a part of your internal operations. They can be part of meetings, share updates, and ensure active participation. Build a sense of ownership by involving them in decision-making processes where relevant.\n\nEstablish performance metrics\n\nDefine KPIs or milestones to track the extended team’s progress. Schedule regular reviews to ensure goals are being met and adjust workflows as needed.\n\nMaintain open communication\n\nKeep lines of communication open to address challenges, provide feedback, and celebrate successes.\n\nEvaluate and scale as needed\n\nPeriodically review the collaboration to assess its effectiveness. If your business needs evolve, scale the team up or down by working with your provider to adjust the team’s size or expertise.\n\nExtended Team\n\nmodels at Near Partner\n\nAt Near Partner we work with\n\nseveral models of nearshore\n\n. This is our way of work with customers all over the world in a nutshell.\n\nExtended Team\n\nOur extended team acts as an extension of your in-house staff, not as a replacement. The collaboration in this model relies on providing additional business and technical expertise to your team, bridging\n\nskill gaps\n\nin your core staff.\n\nThat being said, you and your business keep complete control over whichever project or task is at hand. The communication between you, your in-house team, and our extended team is continuous and direct. Your staff and our off-site developers function as a single tight-knit unit.\n\nAs a result, all team members (both in-house and outsourced) share responsibility. Both teams are equally invested in building the product, and both teams are equally responsible for its success or failure.\n\nManaged Team\n\nA managed team, which in the end acts as an extension of your current team, works slightly differently from the Extended Team model. After outlining the project requirements – in terms of skills, number of team members, timeframe, etc – we assign a dedicated team and the team members’ respective roles (Software Developers, PM’s, Engineers, or others) to your business.\n\nWhile the managed team can work closely with your in-house team, the level of collaboration is for you to decide. However, all responsibility and accountability for the project lie at our end. We will build the product and focus on providing the expected results.\n\nBasically, we assume the management of an area or process, but report directly to you and to your business.\n\nProject Team\n\nThe third kind of the ETM at Near Partner is the Project Team. This means that you, as our client, share your vision and product requirements with our team. Our skilled programmers will then help refine the concept by assessing your solution’s goals, scope, limitations, and target personas, and assume the execution and management of said project.\n\nThis means settling on a schedule that includes key milestones, timeline estimates, delivery schedule, and budget requirements. But although the execution and management are up to us, you and your business will always be engaged with our team in regular meetings and presentations, and a dedicated Project Manager will always be there to inform you on the progress, and to answer any question or issue you may have.\n\nAt Near Partner we have your ideal extended team\n\nOur team at Near Partner is a pool of highly qualified engineers and developers, with several areas of expertise and years of experience in different sectors. Paired with our clients’ wishes, we are able to rapidly build complete teams, ready to work on your projects, from project management to testing. Our teams will ramp up your software development capabilities and\n\nreduce time-to-market\n\n. Are your projects moving faster than your company can manage them? Fret not, we’ll help you speed up the workflow.\n\nAll in all, at Near Partner we see ourselves as\n\ntrue partners\n\n, meaning we devote ourselves to our clients’ business endeavors, sharing in the culture, the challenges and the achievements. This is what we have been doing for\n\nthe last four years\n\n.\n\nGet in touch\n\nand let us advise you and help you find the best solution for your business.",

    "content": "Uncover the truth behind common myths in custom software development\n\nand\n\nfind out if\n\nit can\n\ntransform your business.\n\nIf you’ve recently been part of a software development project—whether as a manager or developer—you’ve likely faced a critical decision: build custom software from the ground up, or leverage off-the-shelf or low-code solutions? This isn’t just another choice; it’s a pivotal one that shapes the flexibility, speed and cost of your product’s development and beyond.\n\nEach option comes with its own set of pros and cons, many of which aren’t immediately obvious. Furthermore, navigating this decision becomes even more challenging if you’re working with misconceptions or incomplete information. To help, we’ve compiled a list of the most common myths surrounding custom software development, so you can make an informed choice.\n\nMyth 1: custom software is only for big companies\n\nYou don’t need to be a multinational corporation to benefit from custom software. This myth persists because some people think custom solutions are expensive and reserved only for massive enterprises. Actually, custom software can be tailored to fit businesses of all sizes. Whether you’re a startup or an established company, there’s room for a solution that perfectly aligns with your goals, at a cost that suits your budget.\n\nSomething to think about\n\n: For very small businesses or startups with limited budgets and simple needs, low-code software may be a more practical solution initially. But as you grow and your needs become more specific, custom software can start to make a lot of sense.\n\nMyth 2: custom software takes forever to build\n\nWhile it’s true that custom software development requires time to plan, design, and develop, it doesn’t have to be a never-ending process. With the right planning, a clear understanding of your needs and a skilled development team, custom software can be delivered in a time frame that works for your business. The key is\n\ngood communication,\n\nwell-defined priorities and realistic timelines, so you’re never left waiting for something that’s far from what you wanted in the first place.\n\nWorth considering\n\n: If your project involves cutting-edge technology or highly specific features, custom software development can take longer due to the complexity. But with the right team and clear goals, the process can be much more efficient than you might expect.\n\nMyth 3: off-the-shelf software is just as good\n\nOff-the-shelf software might work for basic tasks but it often falls short when it comes to addressing the unique challenges of your business. Custom software is designed specifically for you, meaning it can streamline processes,\n\nintegrate with existing systems\n\nand grow alongside your company. Why settle for something that’s generic when you can have a solution that truly fits?\n\nFood for thought\n\n: In certain cases where your business processes are relatively straightforward or standardized, off-the-shelf solutions might do the job just fine. But as your business evolves and becomes more unique, these tools can quickly become limiting.\n\nMyth 4: custom software is too expensive\n\nThis is one of the most persistent myths but it’s not entirely accurate. While the initial investment in custom software may seem high, the long-term value it brings is unparalleled. Consider the money you’ll save by reducing inefficiencies, avoiding software that requires constant updates or workarounds, and enhancing productivity. A custom solution is an investment that pays for itself over time, especially if it’s developed with scalability and futureproofing in mind.\n\nPause for reflection\n\n: it’s worth thinking about how these upfront costs can be offset over time through the scalability, efficiency and adaptability of the solution.\n\nMyth 5: custom software is hard to maintain\n\nThe idea that custom software is difficult to maintain is a myth rooted in fear of the unknown. With proper training, support and updates, custom software can run smoothly for years. Plus, if you’re working with a reputable development team, like\n\nNear Partner\n\n, you’ll have ongoing support and updates, ensuring your software remains relevant and efficient in the long run.\n\nConsider this\n\n: If the custom software isn’t built with clear documentation or scalability in mind, or if it’s created by a team without long-term support plans, maintenance can become a challenge. But with the right development partner, this risk can be minimized.\n\nConclusion: the truth behind custom software\n\nCustom software development doesn’t have to be daunting or out of your reach. The myths are just that – myths.\n\nWhen you partner with a skilled team that understands your business, you can make the right choice for your needs – whether it’s a custom-built solution or an off-the-shelf option. At\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we’re ready to guide you through the decision-making process and help you find the best solution tailored to your goals.\n\nLet’s talk about your ne",

It provides full control over features, scalability and integrations.\n\nWhen to choose:\n\nIdeal for businesses with unique processes, high-security needs or complex systems that off-the-shelf solutions can’t support.\n\nOff-the-Shelf Software\n\nThese are pre-packaged software solutions designed for general use across industries. They’re ready to deploy but may lack customization. An example would be using QuickBooks for accounting or Salesforce for customer relationship management.\n\nWhen to choose:\n\nBest for businesses that need quick, affordable solutions for standard tasks like payroll, CRM, or project management.\n\nLow-Code Platforms\n\nLow-code solutions rely on development platforms that minimize manual coding by providing pre-built modules and drag-and-drop interfaces. They allow for faster development of semi-customized solutions. For instance, you can create a customer portal with Mendix or Microsoft PowerApps that integrates with your existing ERP system.\n\nWhen to choose:\n\nPerfect for businesses that need customized applications quickly but don’t have the resources for fully bespoke software.\n\nNo-Code Platforms\n\nNo-code platforms are user-friendly platforms that let non-developers build software using visual interfaces without any coding knowledge. While quick and affordable, they are less customizable. A common use case are internal task management tools built with Airtable or Zapier\n\nWhen to choose:\n\nSuitable for simple applications or workflows, especially in startups or small businesses with limited technical resources.\n\nBespoke software development step-by-step\n\nHere’s how to approach a bespoke software development project.\n\nDefine scope and prioritize\n\nStart by clearly articulating the problem your solution should solve. For example, you can state the problem as “we need a centralized platform to streamline inventory management across multiple warehouses.”\n\nSplit your objectives into two categories: core goals and stretch goals. The first ones are non-negotiables: what must the software achieve to be considered a success? The second ones are the\n\nnice-to-haves\n\nthat would enhance the solution but aren’t critical for launch.\n\nAlso, consider how much are you willing to invest to solve the problem, when the solution needs to be operational and if you have an in-house team to support the project. Once your goals (and budget) are clear, it’s time to focus on the essentials. Rank features by impact and keep the user at the center.\n\nAsk yourself: do we\n\nreally\n\nneed bespoke software?\n\nBefore you start daydreaming about\n\ncustom dashboards\n\nand perfectly\n\ntailored workflows\n\n, take a moment to evaluate whether bespoke software is truly the best route. It’s easy to get swept up in the idea of having something uniquely yours but bespoke development is a significant commitment – in time, money and energy. Not every business problem requires a bespoke approach.\n\nHere’s how to figure out if bespoke software is necessary, or if a low-code or off-the-shelf solution will get the job done:\n\nWhen low-code or off-the-shelf solutions shine\n\nStraightforward needs\n\n: If your requirements are relatively common – say,\n\nautomating\n\nworkflows, managing customer data or\n\ntracking inventory\n\n– low-code platforms or existing software might be more than enough. These solutions are quick to implement and deploy, cost-effective and often come with ongoing support.\n\nRapid iteration\n\n: If speed is critical and you’re testing the waters with a new idea or process,\n\nlow-code\n\nallows you to get something functional up and running in a matter of days or weeks, not months.\n\nLimited resources\n\n: Smaller budgets or lean teams may benefit from the simplicity and affordability of low-code tools.\n\nWhen bespoke software development is the right choice\n\nOn the flip side, there are scenarios where off-the-shelf solutions or low-code platforms simply won’t cut it:\n\nComplexity\n\n: If your business operates in a niche market with processes that don’t fit into generic templates, bespoke software can be the answer.\n\nScalability\n\n: Pre-packaged solutions often struggle to keep up with businesses experiencing rapid growth or unique demands. Custom software lets you build with the future in mind.\n\nCompetitive edge\n\n: If your software is customer-facing or critical to your brand, bespoke allows you to deliver an experience that differentiates you in the market.\n\nHeavy integration needs\n\n: If you need your software to seamlessly communicate with multiple other systems – especially\n\nlegacy or proprietary systems\n\n– a custom approach might be unavoidable.\n\nThe Bespoke Test\n\nBefore making the call, ask yourself:\n\nAre we trying to solve a unique problem?\n\nIf not, off-the-shelf solutions may suffice.\n\nWill this software give us a strategic advantage?\n\nIf the answer is no, a generic tool might be fine.\n\nHow urgent is the need?\n\nIf speed is of the essence, starting with low-code can bridge the gap while you plan for something more tailored.\n\nDo we have the resources?\n\nBespoke development requires not just money but time, stakeholder input and ongoing maintenance.\n\nMVP it, even if you’re committed to custom software\n\nLet’s say bespoke software is the answer. Excellent choice – probably. But hold on; before diving into full-scale custom development, let’s talk MVP (Minimum Viable Product).\n\nAn MVP is a pared-down version of your ideal solution, focusing on the core features that deliver value. It’s about validating assumptions, minimizing risk and avoiding the trap of over-engineering from the start. An MVP helps you gather actual user feedback, revealing which features are essential and which are, frankly, unnecessary. Here’s how to build an MVP that works.\n\nDefine your core functionality\n\n: What’s the one thing this software must do to solve your immediate problem? For example, if you’re building a customer portal, start with basic account management and data visualization rather than full personalization.\n\nLeverage low-code tools strategically\n\n: Platforms like\n\nOutSystems\n\nare ideal for MVPs. They’re quick to deploy, don’t require a full development team and often come with integrations for commonly used systems.\n\nIterate based on feedback\n\n: Once users interact with your MVP, their behaviour will tell you what’s working and what’s not. Use this feedback to refine your roadmap for bespoke development.\n\nFigure out when it is time to move beyond MVPs – and when it’s not\n\nYou’re probably wondering: when do I know it’s time to move beyond MVP? Well, if your MVP reveals gaps that low-code can’t bridge, like\n\nadvanced integrations\n\n, superior performance requirements, or industry-specific compliance needs, it’s time to start planning for bespoke development. But now, you’ll approach it with a validated feature set, a better understanding of your processes and a justified investment.\n\nChoose the right development partner\n\nChoosing the right development partner is as crucial as deciding to go bespoke in the first place. The wrong choice can cost you time, money and even your peace of mind. Here’s how to filter the contenders from the pretenders:\n\nExpertise that matches your needs:\n\nLook for a team with experience in the type of solution you’re building. If you’re building a logistics platform, a partner specializing in gaming apps probably isn’t your best bet. Also, familiarity with your industry can be a big bonus, especially if your software requires niche features or compliance with regulations.\n\nTrack record of success:\n\nAsk to see\n\ncase studies\n\nor client testimonials. Better yet, speak directly to their past clients to understand how the team operates and delivers.\n\nCommunication skills:\n\nTechnical brilliance is great, but it’s useless without\n\nclear, regular communication\n\n. You need a partner who can translate\n\ntech lingo\n\ninto plain language and keep you in the loop. Do they listen to your needs or do they push their own agenda?\n\nFlexibility and scalability:\n\nA good partner will understand that requirements evolve. They should be flexible enough to adapt to changes without derailing the project. Additionally, ensure they can scale their team if your project grows in complexity or scope.\n\nCultural fit:\n\nWorking with a partner whose values and working style align with yours can make or break the relationship. Collaboration is much efficient when there’s mutual respect and understanding.\n\nWith\n\nNear Partner\n\n, you’ll get the right mix of experience, communication, and a proven track record in delivering bespoke solutions that truly fit.\n\nBring your vision to life but avoid these common bespoke software development pitfalls\n\nThe development phase is where your bespoke software transforms from concept to reality. This is the time to balance ambition with practicality.\n\nTips for Success\n\nPrioritize Your Core Features\n\n: Focus on delivering the most impactful features first. Customization is great, but spending too much time on “nice-to-haves” can derail timelines and inflate costs.\n\nKeep the User Front and Center\n\n: Regularly review progress from a user’s perspective. Early feedback helps you refine features and avoid expensive rewrites later.\n\nDocument Everything\n\n: While documentation may not feel exciting, it’s essential. User manuals, API documentation and system architecture details ensure future updates and integrations are smooth and error-free, as well as facilitating maintenance when things don’t go as expected.\n\nKeep it agile\n\n: While having a clear master plan is critical, breaking it into manageable sprints ensures steady progress and keeps your project on track. For example, Sprint 1 might focus on creating a seamless user authentication system, while Sprint 2 handles intuitive data visualization.\n\nPitfalls to Avoid\n\nOverloading with Features\n\n: Adding unnecessary bells and whistles not only delays completion but can also complicate the user experience.\n\nRemember, less is often more.\n\nNeglecting Scalability\n\n: Build with the future in mind. A system that can’t scale with your business will lead to costly overhauls down the road.\n\nEnsure rigorous testing\n\nBuilding the software is only half the battle; rigorous testing ensures it actually works as intended.\n\nUnit Testing:\n\nEvery piece of code should be tested in isolation to ensure it works as intended. Developers handle this early in the process to catch bugs before they snowball.\n\nIntegration Testing:\n\nOnce individual components are built, test how they work together. This step identifies issues like data not syncing properly between systems or misaligned workflows.\n\nUser Acceptance Testing (UAT):\n\nThis is where real users (or representatives) get their hands on the software. UAT ensures the product meets actual user needs and business goals.\n\nPerformance Testing:\n\nBefore launch, simulate heavy usage to ensure your software can handle peak loads. Nobody wants a shiny new platform that crashes the moment traffic spikes.\n\nBespoke software development: is it for you?\n\nBespoke software development is as much about strategy as it is about innovation. By questioning whether bespoke is truly necessary, starting with a low-code MVP, planning meticulously, choosing the right development partner, and building and testing intelligently, you set your project up for long-term success.\n\nSo, is it time to go bespoke or stick with low-code? Check out the table below for a quick cheat sheet:\n\nStick With Low-Code Long-Term\n\nGo Bespoke\n\nYou need to launch quickly with minimal upfront cost.\n\nYou have highly specific needs that off-the-shelf tools can’t meet.\n\nThe solution is for internal use with limited scalability requirements.\n\nThe software is customer-facing and central to your brand experience.\n\nCustomization isn’t critical to your business goals.\n\nYou need to integrate deeply with existing systems or complex workflows.\n\nYou’re testing a new business idea or product concept.\n\nSecurity, compliance, or performance are deal-breakers.\n\nYour team has limited technical expertise.\n\nYour business demands unique functionality and differentiation.\n\nBespoke software development: FAQs\n\nIf you’re thinking about starting a new custom software project, you’re likely buzzing with questions.

    "content": "Efficiency. A word so overused it’s almost meaningless. But peel back the corporate layer, and what do you find? A principle that, when applied correctly, separates industry leaders from those trying to keep up. We’ll break business efficiency down, sector by sector, and explore how to achieve it.\n\nWhat is business efficiency, really?\n\nBusiness efficiency is the pursuit of an output while minimising wasted resources, all without compromising on quality or customer satisfaction. It’s the ability to turn limited inputs – time, money, and manpower – into maximum results.\n\nFor some companies, it means automating the mundane. For others, it’s about fine-tuning operations until they run like a well-oiled machine. The true power of efficiency lies in knowing exactly what your business needs, and exploiting the right strategies, tools, and technologies to make it happen.\n\nWhat business efficiency looks like in your industry\n\nHere’s a real look at what efficiency means across sectors and how to make it work for you.\n\nTelecom\n\nEfficiency here is about precision: streamlining complex operations, reducing bottlenecks, and ensuring that every piece of technology is working in harmony. It’s about future-proofing the system, ensuring that your network can scale to meet tomorrow’s demands while staying ahead of competitors.\n\nFor telecom providers, this means finding smarter ways to handle customer service, troubleshoot issues proactively, and manage massive amounts of data in real-time. In fact, these companies empower economies, industries, and individuals to function seamlessly. Any inefficiency becomes a vulnerability that competitors will gladly exploit.\n\nHow to achieve it:\n\nAutomated network management\n\n: AI-driven systems already predict outages and optimise bandwidth more precisely and faster than humans.\n\nScalable customer support\n\n: Telecom support lines are infamous for long wait times. Intelligent chatbots and customised CRM solutions (like\n\nSalesforce integrations\n\n) empower teams to handle more requests while improving the customer experience.\n\nSmarter infrastructure investments\n\n: Advanced analytics tools identify where to build, upgrade, or retire infrastructure for maximum ROI.\n\nFrictionless billing\n\n: Streamlined, transparent billing systems reduce customer complaints and improve retention.\n\nTailored billing solutions\n\ncan integrate seamlessly with legacy systems.\n\nOptimised deployment of 5G and IoT\n\n: These technologies can make a difference, but only if rolled out efficiently.\n\nSitetracker\n\n: This software can help you manage everything from network rollouts to infrastructure upgrades with precision and efficiency. Sitetracker streamlines project tracking, for better visibility, faster execution, and clearer communication across all stages of deployment.\n\nRetail\n\nIn retail, it’s no longer enough to have an attractive product on the shelf. Retailers must deliver the right products, in the right place, at the right time, while managing increasingly complex supply chains, digital touchpoints, and\n\ncustomer expectations\n\n. In a world where consumers can browse and buy from anywhere, inefficiency can quickly lead to lost sales and damaged reputation.\n\nRetailers need to stay agile, anticipate shifts in demand, and ensure that their operations scale as needed without falling into the trap of overcomplicating things. From inventory management to sales forecasting, from in-store experiences to e-commerce platforms, every part of the business must function as a well-tuned machine to keep up with demand.\n\nHow to achieve it:\n\nDemand forecasting\n\n: Leverage\n\nreal-time analytics\n\nto predict what’s flying off shelves tomorrow. A custom-built platform can integrate these insights into your supply chain.\n\nAdvanced inventory management\n\n: Dynamic inventory management systems ensure you never sit on excess stock or suffer from shortages.\n\nPersonalised customer experiences\n\n: Today’s shoppers want to feel seen. Advanced\n\nCRM tools, like Salesforce\n\n, customised for retail, can deliver hyper-personalised recommendations at scale.\n\nOmnichannel integration\n\n: From online to brick-and-mortar, customers expect a unified experience. Unified software platforms ensure your touchpoints feel seamless.\n\nHealthcare\n\nEvery day,\n\nhealthcare systems\n\nare tasked with managing large volumes of patients, handling complex cases, and meeting stringent regulatory requirements – all while staying on budget. The margin for error is razor-thin, and inefficiency has consequences that ripple far beyond just financial costs.\n\nTrue efficiency in healthcare means streamlining administrative processes, optimising care delivery, and ensuring that resources – whether human or medical – are used in the most effective way possible.\n\nHow to achieve it:\n\nInteroperable patient records\n\n: Centralised, secure platforms ensure that patient information flows seamlessly between departments and facilities. Custom software solutions can\n\nintegrate legacy systems\n\nwithout a full overhaul.\n\nSmarter scheduling\n\n: AI-powered systems can optimise patient appointments and staff allocation.\n\nTelehealth that works\n\n: Telemedicine exploded in recent years, but not all platforms deliver the reliability or user-friendliness required. Custom-built telehealth solutions ensure smooth consultations, whether for rural patients or international collaborations.\n\nPredictive analytics for patient outcomes\n\n: Harness real-time data to anticipate complications before they occur. With platforms like\n\nOutSystems\n\n, healthcare organisations can quickly develop tools tailored to their needs.\n\nCompliance without complexity\n\n: Navigating regulations is exhausting. Automation tools can simplify\n\ncompliance tracking\n\n.\n\nManufacturing\n\nIn manufacturing, business efficiency is about achieving the perfect balance between speed, quality, and cost. Every delay, every defective product, every moment of downtime matters.\n\nEfficiency in this sector means mastering the art of doing more with less – less time, less waste, less energy. Businesses must refine processes to produce custom goods at scale, adapt to fluctuating market demands, and embrace technologies that reduce inefficiencies at every stage of production. Whether it’s optimising supply chains, minimising energy consumption, or cutting production time, efficiency in manufacturing is a relentless pursuit of improvement.\n\nHow to achieve it:\n\nThe smart factory\n\n: IoT-enabled systems monitor and optimise equipment performance in real-time, reducing downtime and improving output. Tailored solutions can make even older machinery smarter.\n\nPredictive maintenance\n\n: New AI-powered systems anticipate equipment failures and schedule maintenance proactively, avoiding costly halts.\n\nStreamlined supply chains\n\n: Use real-time data to predict disruptions and respond dynamically. Integrated platforms ensure every link in your chain communicates efficiently.\n\nLean inventory management\n\n: Avoid overstocking or understocking by leveraging advanced analytics that align production with actual demand. A Salesforce-integrated solution can bring visibility and precision here.\n\nEnergy efficiency without sacrifice\n\n: Reduce energy waste through automation and IoT insights, cutting costs while meeting sustainability goals.\n\nFinance\n\nFinance operates in two unforgiving dimensions: speed and accuracy. Transactions need to be instantaneous. Risk assessments must be flawless. Clients expect digital-first solutions that don’t glitch at the eleventh hour. At the same time, regulators hover over every move, leaving zero room for error.\n\nHow to achieve it:\n\nAutomate routine tasks:\n\nImplement\n\nrobotic process automation (RPA)\n\nto manage repetitive tasks like data entry, reconciliation, and reporting, freeing up staff for strategic work.\n\nAdopt real-time analytics:\n\nLeverage data platforms that provide up-to-the-minute insights into market trends, customer behaviour, and performance metrics.\n\nEnhance fraud detection:\n\nUse machine learning algorithms to identify anomalies and detect fraud before it causes major disruptions or financial losses.\n\nOptimise client experiences:\n\nInvest in digital platforms that offer personalised financial services, intuitive interfaces, and faster transaction processing to meet modern customer expectations. Platforms like Salesforce, when customised properly, allow for scalable, personalised interactions.\n\nBusiness efficiency with Near Partner\n\nIt’s worth remembering building efficiency isn’t just about tools – it’s about the expertise behind them. At\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we understand that no two industries – and no two businesses – are alike.

Meanwhile,\n\nTikTok faces a lawsuit\n\nfor infringing on the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act by mishandling personal information from children under the age of 13. In another instance, credit bureau Equifax paid a hefty\n\n$575 million settlement\n\nin 2019 for failing to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\n\nThese three examples serve as stark reminders of the critical importance of compliance. As a result, many are turning to Compliance Management Software to help them keep track of regulatory changes, minimize legal risks and unify various data protection rules. Discover what a Compliance Management Software actually is, what features you can benefit from and to choose the right one for you.\n\nWhat is Compliance Management Software?\n\nAt its core, Compliance Management Software (CMS) is a digital tool designed to help businesses manage and automate their compliance processes. It provides a centralized platform where you can track, monitor, and report on compliance-related tasks across your organization. CMS ensures nothing falls through the cracks when it comes to adhering to industry-specific regulations like GDPR, SOX, or HIPAA, or even maintaining internal policies.\n\nNaturally, compliance can mean different things to different people and organizations. For some, it may revolve around ensuring that branding and marketing materials adhere to established guidelines and regulations. For others, compliance might focus on employment processes, such as adhering to labour laws and maintaining fair workplace practices. Additionally, local regulations can require businesses to align with specific legal standards.\n\nWhy your business needs Compliance Management Software\n\nYou might wonder if a Compliance Management Software is really needed. The answer is almost always yes, especially as regulations and industry standards become more stringent.\n\nRisk mitigation\n\nWithout a streamlined system in place, it’s easy to overlook critical compliance tasks.

CMS helps you assign tasks to specific team members, set deadlines, and track completion. This transparency promotes accountability and ensures everyone knows their role in maintaining compliance.\n\nKey features of Compliance Management Software\n\nNot all compliance management software is created equal, but the best solutions share a few critical features that will make managing compliance far less daunting. Here’s what to look for:\n\nAutomated alerts and reminders\n\nThe last thing you want is to miss a compliance deadline. Look for software that automatically sends notifications about upcoming tasks, audits, and regulatory changes, ensuring you stay ahead of any issues.\n\nAudit trails\n\nIf you’re audited, you need to show proof of compliance. A good CMS will offer detailed audit trails that document every action taken within the platform, giving you a complete record of who did what and when.\n\nCustomizable dashboards\n\nEvery business has unique compliance needs, so it’s important to have software that allows you to\n\ncustomize your dashboard\n\n. This way, you can track the metrics that matter most to your organization and get a real-time view of your compliance status.\n\nRegulatory change management\n\nRegulations are constantly evolving, which can make it difficult to stay on top of changes. Make sure you CMS platform offer built-in regulatory tracking, so you’ll be notified whenever new rules or updates that affect your business come into play.\n\nChoosing the right Compliance Management Software for your business\n\nNow that we’ve covered the key features you can benefit from, how do you go about selecting the right Compliance Management Software for your company?

Learn the secrets behind software that users love.\n\nA seamless software experience can make or break\n\ncustomer loyalty\n\n. Whether it’s an app, a platform, or a service, the quality of the customer experience is what turns one-time users into lifelong fans. But what does “great customer experience” actually mean when it comes to software? Spoiler: it’s not just about having the latest features. It’s about understanding your users and helping them complete key tasks, in the simplest, most effective way possible.\n\nAs you will discover in this article, feedback is a keyword and important part of a great customer experience. At Near Partner, as Agile practitioners, we tend to focus more on delivering outcomes, which are the customer expectations, than on the outputs, which are the deliverables. By using the\n\nScrum framework\n\n, we also maximise the product value by gathering and integrating users’ feedback.\n\nWhat is customer experience?\n\nCustomer experience (often abbreviated as CX) refers to the overall impression and emotions a user has when interacting with a company, product, or service. It involves every touchpoint a customer has with a brand – from discovery to usage, to support, and beyond.\n\nA great customer experience leaves users feeling satisfied, valued, and understood. It solves their immediate problem through a journey as smooth, enjoyable, and efficient as possible.\n\nCustomer experience is the sum of all interactions a user has with your brand, and how those interactions make them feel.\n\nWhen it comes to software, customer experience takes on a slightly different dimension. Here, CX is about how users interact with the software itself – from the very first time they download or log in, to every feature they engage with, and even to how they receive support if something goes wrong.\n\nHow to measure customer experience?\n\nThere are several key methods and metrics to assess the quality of customer experience in software.\n\nSome methods will give you a high-level idea about customers’ satisfaction with your product or service, as a rating, and this information might be enough for you to identify a trend, a red flag or just confirm your idea, whereas other will give you more detailed insights with valuable feedback to enhance your product or identify any defect.\n\nNet Promoter Score (NPS)\n\nThe Net Promoter Score is one of the most popular metrics for measuring customer experience. It asks users a simple question:\n\n“On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend this software to a friend or colleague?”\n\nPromoters\n\n(score 9-10) are loyal users who are likely to recommend your software.\n\nPassives\n\n(score 7-8) are satisfied but may switch to a competitor if offered a better deal.\n\nDetractors\n\n(score 0-6) are unhappy users who could harm your brand reputation through negative feedback.\n\nNPS gives you a clear sense of how users feel about the overall experience and highlights how many of them are strong advocates.\n\nCustomer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)\n\nThe Customer Satisfaction Score directly asks users how satisfied they are with your software, typically after an interaction like completing a task, contacting support, or using a feature. It’s usually framed as:\n\n“How would you rate your satisfaction with this software?”\n\nUsers select a rating, typically from 1 to 5. This metric provides immediate insights into how users feel about specific aspects of their experience.\n\nUser Retention\n\nUser Satisfaction and product value can be measured through the number of users keeping using your product, with the User Retention Rate, or through the number of users stopping using your product, with the Churn Rate.\n\nBoth are critical metrics for understanding long-term user satisfaction.\n\nA low retention rate or a high churn rate often signals a poor user experience. Perhaps the software isn’t meeting expectations, is too complicated, lacks features, has unresolved bugs, fails to engage users effectively, or even can be related to better competitors’ options.\n\nUser Retention Rate\n\nRetention rate is a powerful metric that shows how many users stick with your software over time. A high retention rate indicates that users find long-term value in the product, which is a strong indicator of a positive customer experience.\n\nHow to calculate\n\n:\n\nRetention Rate (%) = [(Number of users at the end of the period – New users during the period) / Number of users at the start of the period] x 100\n\nChurn Rate\n\nChurn Rate measures the percentage of users who stop using your software over a given period. Analysing churn rate can help you identify at what point users are leaving, enabling you to focus on improving that stage of the user journey.\n\nHow to calculate\n\n:\n\nChurn Rate (%) = (Users who left during a period / Total users at the start of the period) x 100\n\nCustomer Effort Score (CES)\n\nThe Customer Effort Score measures how easy it is for users to accomplish a task within your software. This is key for software products, as a high-effort experience can lead to frustration and abandonment. Users answer a question like:\n\n“How easy was it to complete your task today?”\n\nThe responses, typically rated on a scale from 1 (very difficult) to 7 (very easy), help gauge how much friction users encounter while using the software. The easier it is, the better the customer experience.\n\nBased on the rating, you might review the user experience journey and processes, make your product more user-friendly, or add tutorials, help for a specific step and FAQs.\n\nProduct Usage Analytics\n\nExamining how users interact with your software – such as which features they use the most, how long they stay logged in, or where they drop off – can give valuable insights into the customer experience. Some tools can track these user behaviours, allowing you to see if users are completing tasks, where they encounter obstacles or confusion and find out which features are being underused, possibly indicating they’re not intuitive or unnecessary.\n\nCustomer Feedback and Reviews\n\nCollecting feedback through surveys, interviews, or online reviews (like those on app stores or product forums) can give you direct insights into how users perceive your software. Look for patterns in the feedback to identify common pain points or praise, and to define new features or resolve bugs.\n\nPro tip\n\n: Regularly reach out to users for feedback, especially after major updates or feature releases. This helps ensure that your product is continually evolving based on real user needs.\n\nSupport Tickets and Resolution Time\n\nTracking the number of support tickets and the average resolution time gives insight into the pain points users encounter. A high number of tickets might indicate areas of confusion, frequent bugs in the software\n\nor lack of help or support as FAQs or tutorials\n\n, while long resolution times could frustrate users and lead to dissatisfaction.\n\nWhat really makes a great customer experience?\n\nLet’s break down the key elements that truly define a great customer experience in software.\n\nSimplicity\n\nOne of the hallmarks of a great customer experience in software is simplicity. We’ve all been there: staring at a complex interface, unsure where to click, or drowning in options we don’t need. The best software eliminates this friction and makes next steps very clear.\n\nWhat makes a platform great isn’t how many features it has, but how easy it is to navigate and use. Simplicity doesn’t mean stripping things down – it means making the necessary feel effortless.\n\nPro tip\n\n: Test your software by asking real users to perform common tasks. Watch where they stumble and take notes. If they’re frustrated, it’s a sign it needs to be clearer and more intuitive.\n\nSpeed and reliability\n\nSpeed is everything in the digital world. Nobody has the patience for software that’s slow to load or freezes at the worst moment. This is more than just a convenience issue – speed is a crucial part of user satisfaction. A great customer experience requires software that’s reliable. Bugs, crashes, and glitches are obvious deal-breakers.\n\nPersonalization\n\nToday’s users want experiences tailored to them. They want software that adapts to their needs, remembers their preferences, and grows with them.\n\nPersonalization in software\n\ncan range from\n\ncustomized dashboards\n\nto recommendations based on user behaviour.\n\nClear communication and support\n\nNo matter how simple and reliable your software is, users will occasionally need help. Offering multiple ways to reach support, such as live chat, detailed FAQs, or in-app assistance, makes all the difference.\n\nThe key is making sure that help is easily accessible and timely. Long wait times, robotic responses, or lack of clarity can quickly sour even the best experience.\n\nBest practice\n\n: Don’t bury the help button. Ensure users know where to find support and provide them with fast, human-like responses.\n\nConstant evolution\n\nThe software world moves fast, and user expectations evolve even faster. You need to constantly gather feedback, fix pain points, and release updates that actually solve real problems.\n\nUsers appreciate knowing their voice matters. Implementing their feedback shows you’re invested in delivering a product that evolves with their needs.\n\nPro tip\n\n: Ask for feedback and act on it. Show your users you’re listening by prioritizing the features and fixes they care about most.\n\nEmotional connection\n\nGreat software resonates emotionally with its users. Whether through delightful micro-interactions, a clean aesthetic, or smooth onboarding, your software should make people feel something. This emotional connection is often the “X factor” that separates good software from great. It’s what turns users into loyal advocates who recommend your product to others.\n\nBest practice\n\n: Don’t underestimate the power of small, thoughtful details that delight your users.\n\nHow to create a great user experience\n\nHere’s a step-by-step guide on how to make it happen:\n\nGather data\n\nStart with data. You can’t improve what you don’t understand,\n\ndon’t know\n\nor don’t measure\n\n, so dive into user analytics, customer behaviour, and patterns. See which features are getting the most use, where users tend to drop off, and what paths they take to complete tasks. This will give you a clear picture of what’s working and what’s not.\n\nBut don’t stop there. Dive deeper into the numbers – track things like session duration, bounce rates, and heat maps. These details tell you how users navigate through your software and where they might be hitting roadblocks. Are people spending more time on certain pages? Are they clicking the right buttons, or getting stuck?\n\nThe more data you have, the better you’ll understand your users’ needs, and the easier it will be to tailor the experience to meet those needs.\n\nMake sure this\n\ndata is clear and visible enough\n\nand always up to date, shared inside your team with product owners, designers or developers.\n\nTalk to users\n\nData is great, but it’s only half the story. To really understand what your users are experiencing, you’ve got to talk to them. Set up interviews, send out surveys, or even jump on a quick call with a few of your users.\n\nCollect their feedback about bugs or malfunctions\n\n. Ask them directly about their likes, dislikes, and what’s frustrating them about your software.\n\nWhen you actually speak with users, you get insights you’d never find in analytics. Maybe there’s a feature they’re totally missing because it’s buried, or perhaps something that seems simple to you is confusing to them. It’s all about hearing their perspective and getting that “aha!” moment that numbers just can’t provide.\n\nAsk them what they’d like to see improved,\n\nif they miss any feature to take full profit of your solution\n\n, what features they use the most, and how they feel when using your software. Plus, engaging with your users shows that you care about their experience, which can strengthen their loyalty to your product.\n\nDefine key use cases\n\nNow that you’ve gathered data and talked to your users, it’s time to focus on what really matters: the key use cases. These are the main reasons why people are using your software. What tasks do they need to accomplish? What’s the most important thing they want to get done?\n\nThis will help you define and build\n\nfeatures that directly address user requirements.\n\nUsers come to your software for specific goals. Maybe it’s managing projects, tracking expenses, or just organizing their day. Whatever it is, you need to define these core use cases so you can streamline the experience around them.\n\nThe idea here is to make sure the most important features and tasks are front and center, easy to access, and as smooth as possible. By focusing on what your users really need, you avoid overwhelming them with unnecessary options. Users should be able to achieve their main objectives with minimal friction.\n\nDefining personas can also help you\n\nunderstand typical users behaviours and preferences, shifting the focus from features and functionalities to the actual needs and preferences of the end users.\n\nStreamline tasks\n\nOnce you’ve identified those key use cases, it’s time to make things as easy as possible for your users. The goal here is to streamline tasks – basically, remove any unnecessary steps or complexity that slows people down.\n\nThe less effort users need to put in, the better their experience will be. Ask yourself, “How can we make this process faster or more intuitive?” Maybe it’s reducing the number of clicks needed to complete a task, automating repetitive actions, or simplifying the navigation. If users can get things done quickly and effortlessly, they’re way more likely to stick around.\n\nFocus on cutting out the clutter and giving users a clear path to follow. Make sure that every interaction feels smooth, logical, and, most importantly, not frustrating. A streamlined experience is one that users will keep coming back to.\n\nImplement mockups\n\nBefore jumping into development, it’s smart to create mockups. These are simple, visual drafts of how your software will look and work. Mockups give you a chance to experiment with your ideas without committing a lot of time or resources.\n\nMockups can be basic wireframes or quick sketches that map out how users will navigate and interact with your software. The goal here is to visualize the user flow, placing key features and buttons where they make the most sense.\n\nGather feedback\n\nOnce your mockups are ready, it’s time to gather feedback. This is where you put your ideas to the test and see how real people react to them. Share your mockups with users, your team, or stakeholders and ask for honest opinions. Do the designs make sense? Is it easy to find what you need? Are there any confusing parts? The earlier you catch potential problems, the easier they are to fix.\n\nBuild an MVP\n\nOnce you’ve gathered feedback and made the necessary tweaks, it’s time to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The MVP is a stripped-down version of your software that includes just the core features users need to accomplish their main tasks. It’s not about being perfect – it’s about getting a functional product into users’ hands as quickly as possible.\n\nThe beauty of an MVP is that it allows you to test your product in the real world without spending too much time and resources on unnecessary features. It helps you learn what works and what doesn’t, based on actual user interaction. From there, you can refine, iterate, and improve.\n\nExpand capabilities\n\nAfter your MVP is up and running, and you’ve gathered real-world feedback, it’s time to start expanding capabilities. Now that you know which features your users find valuable, you can gradually introduce new ones or enhance existing functionality based on their needs.\n\nBut don’t rush to add everything at once. Prioritize the features that will have the biggest impact on your users’ experience. It’s all about building on the solid foundation you’ve created with your MVP and making sure each new addition truly adds value.\n\nAs you expand, keep the user experience in mind. Adding capabilities should make things easier or more enjoyable for your users, not more complicated. Keep testing and gathering feedback as you roll out new features to ensure everything integrates effortlessly and continues to meet user expectations.\n\nTest, test, test\n\nTesting never really stops. Run usability tests, monitor how people interact with your software, and always be on the lookout for areas that can be improved. A great user experience evolves over time, and testing ensures that your software stays user-friendly as it grows.\n\nElevate your customer experience in software with Near Partner\n\nBusinesses live or die by their reputation, and keeping loyal customers is key to staying successful.

    "content": "Are dashboards dead? As the data needs of modern users evolve, the traditional role of dashboards in\n\nBusiness Intelligence (BI)\n\nis being questioned.\n\nSome have boldly declared dashboards obsolete\n\n. But is this really the case?\n\nSure, dashboards may be limited in terms of complexity and rather rigid. Once created, they cannot easily be customized or changed. This makes it difficult to keep them up-to-date and accurate as your data changes over time. And as the amount of data increases, so makes the effort required to maintain and update their accuracy.\n\nWhile dashboards are no longer the sole means of communicating key data to businesses, their decline is not the end of their usefulness. Instead, it marks the onset of a new era in analytics solutions. Today, businesses recognize that dashboards are not a ‘one size fits all’ solution. Newer analytics features are emerging, easily adopted alongside dashboards, to better meet the evolving BI needs of regular business users. The rise of exciting technologies, such as automated analytics, augmented technologies and contextualized insights, has democratized data analysis and opened up new data-led opportunities. Many of these technologies do not require advanced technical expertise or know-how.\n\nSo, should you build a great KPI dashboard today? The answer is still yes – if you keep these 7 key traits in mind when building or updating your next dashboard.\n\n7 elements of a powerful KPI dashboard\n\nClarity is\n\nk\n\ney\n\nKPI dashboards should be crystal clear, stripping away the unnecessary noise and presenting information in a way that’s easy to understand at a glance. Whether it’s sales figures, website traffic, or\n\ncustomer satisfaction\n\nscores, clarity ensures that everyone from the CEO to the intern can quickly grasp what’s going on and make informed decisions. When crafting your KPI dashboard, remember: clarity isn’t just important – it’s essential.\n\nHere is an example of design good practices where most important data stands out and noise is reduced to its minimal to only show relevant information.\n\nWhat to do\n\n: Avoid clutter, keep it simple, use appropriate charts (line chart for time trends vs bar charts for comparison) and spotlight the most relevant data to tell the story clearly and easily. It is also possible to use AI to summarize the main conclusions in a short text, so that users don’t have to scroll through the entire dashboard.\n\nRelevant metrics only\n\nDon’t clutter your dashboard with every metric under the sun. That could be tempting, but too much\n\ndata analytics\n\ncan be overwhelming and counterproductive. Instead, focus on the metrics that really matter – the ones that directly tie into your business goals and objectives.\n\nWhat to do\n\n: Choose the metrics appropriate to your audience and to the story you want to convey; a dashboard for financial area will show different metrics than for production, sales or maintenance.\n\nReal-time updates\n\nIn a fast-paced world, yesterday’s data might as well be ancient history. That’s why it’s crucial for your dashboard to provide real-time updates, giving you a constant finger on the pulse of your business. Whether you’re tracking daily sales targets, monitoring social media engagement, or keeping an eye on website traffic, real-time updates ensure that you’re always in the know, keeping you agile and responsive.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nThere’s no doubt about it: Business intelligence (BI) is quickly moving to the top of the priority list for organizations across the world. It started off as a niche but has quickly become the norm for even small-time companies.\n\nHere are the best 10 business intelligence tools to help your business excel.\n\nMake dashboards customizable\n\nOne size does not fit all when it comes to KPI dashboards. Your marketing team has different priorities than your finance department, and that’s okay. A great dashboard allows for customization, letting each user tailor the view to their specific needs – to visual thinkers who love pie charts or numbers person who prefers bar graphs.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nchoose dashboard systems that allow for customisation such as rearrangeable widgets, and picking or filtering which metrics to display and different time frames. In Excel, Pivot Charts is a great option to let your users play with the data using filters, slicers and timelines.\n\nActionable insights\n\nA KPI dashboard shouldn’t just state data – even if looks great. It should serve up actionable insights on a silver platter. Highlight trends, identify outliers, and flag areas that need attention. Think of it as your business’s personal detective, spotting emerging trends, identifying areas for improvement, or seizing new opportunities within the data.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nwhen crafting your dashboard, remember it’s not just about the data – it’s about unearthing the insights that lie beneath the surface.\n\nMobile-friendly design\n\nLet’s face it, we’re all glued to our phones these days, and being tied to a desktop just isn’t practical. A great KPI dashboard is mobile-friendly, allowing you to keep tabs on your business even when you’re on the go. Whether you’re waiting for your morning coffee or lounging on the beach, access to critical data should always be just a tap away.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nThe Salesforce mobile application is fully customizable according to your users’ needs, allowing you to access your dashboards from anywhere.\n\nUser-friendly interface\n\nWhat does user-friendly actually mean? For a KPI dashboard, it probably means that the least tech-savvy person in your organization can access, interact, understand and act on the information displayed. Remember, the goal is to empower users, not confuse them. So, when crafting your dashboard, always keep the end user in mind and strive to create an experience that’s as delightful as it is informative.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nKeep it organized, label everything clearly, and provide tooltips or explanations where needed.\n\nHow we helped Tupperware build a great KPI dashboard\n\nTupperware teamed up with Near Partner to up its application maintenance game. We took over 12 of Tupperware’s crucial applications, used globally by hundreds of users. These applications are vital to Tupperware’s supply chain, production planning and sales analysis.\n\nTupperware’s maintenance is split into two parts: service requests and incidents. Incidents, like bugs, get top priority, while service requests cover smaller fixes and improvements.\n\nHere’s the general dashboard:\n\nNow take a look at some specific widgets:\n\nNumber of incidents and service requests\n\n: We track how many issues pop up and how many get fixed each month and week.\n\nResolution time\n\n:\n\nIncidents get top priority, so they should be resolved quicker than service requests.\n\nStatus of open tickets\n\n:\n\nWe\n\nmonitor\n\nwhere each ticket stands in the resolution process, from open to resolved.\n\nAging time\n\n: Tickets get sorted by how long they’ve been open. The goal aim to clear them out of the older buckets ASAP.\n\nPriority levels\n\n: We prioritize incidents based on their urgency, tackling the critical ones first.\n\nTop locations, users, and ticket categories\n\n: This helps to see where the most support is needed, and which areas might need extra attention.\n\nNear Partner, crafting your perfect KPI dashboard together\n\nWhile some may argue that dashboards are becoming obsolete in the face of evolving data needs and emerging analytics solutions, it’s clear that they still hold significant value. Dashboards are not dead; however, they do require updating and adaptation to meet the changing demands of modern users. By embracing newer analytics features and technologies alongside dashboards, businesses can ensure they remain relevant and effective tools for informed decision-making. Thus, rather than being replaced entirely, dashboards are undergoing a transformation to better serve the evolving BI landscape.

    "content": "About 90% of all strategic plans fail. Discover why\n\nstrategic planning is worth your time and how to do it right.\n\nEvery business should have a strategic plan. Yet, many operate without a defined plan or fail to communicate it – a staggering\n\n86% of executive teams\n\nspend less than an hour per month discussing strategy, while 95% of workers say they’re in the dark about their organization’s strategic direction. That is probably explains why the vast majority of strategic plans, around 9 out of 10 to be exact, never get fully implemented. Is there a way to make tech strategic planning an effective tool, without spending eye watering sums on consulting fees? Here’s how to do it.\n\nWhat is strategic planning?\n\nSimply put, strategic planning is figuring out where you want to go in the future, how you’ll get there, and what you’ll need along the way. You’ll need to set some big goals, decide which initiatives are more likely to take you there, make sure you have enough resources to execute and, crucially, follow-up and adjust as you go.\n\nWhat is strategic plan. Source:\n\nSpur reply\n\nIf done correctly, strategic planning ensures everyone in the organization knows the destination and is working together to reach it, adjusting plans as needed if there are roadblocks or detours. It’s about being proactive and prepared, rather than just reacting to things as they come.\n\nIs strategic planning worth your time?\n\nWith strategic planning, everyone knows exactly where the company is headed and how to get there. Everyone is rowing in the same direction.\n\nStrategic planning also helps you see what could go wrong and make your next move with confidence. It also helps you deploy resources wisely, keep track of your progress and, at the same time, identify areas of success and areas needing improvement.\n\nWith strategic planning, everyone knows exactly where the company is headed and how to get there. Everyone is rowing in the same direction.\n\nStrategic planning also helps you see what could go wrong and make your next move with confidence. It also helps you deploy resources wisely, keep track of your progress and, at the same time, identify areas of success and areas needing improvement.\n\nTypes of Strategic Plans.\n\nSource\n\n:\n\nslidemodel\n\nStrategic planning doesn’t need to be rigid. In fact, it can serve as a yardstick to adjust your plans when things don’t go as expected to respond to new opportunities or challenges and stay ahead of the competition.\n\nStrategic planning: are there limitations?\n\nLike any tool or approach, strategic planning has its limitations. Firstly, it demands considerable\n\ntime and resources\n\n, particularly for smaller organizations with limited human resources and budget.\n\nMoreover, it relies on assumptions about the future, making it vulnerable to unexpected events or changes in the business environment. Additionally, some plans may become too rigid, hindering adaptability to emerging opportunities or challenges.\n\nImplementation can also pose a significant challenge, as poor execution can undermine the effectiveness of even the most well-crafted plan. Resistance to change from stakeholders comfortable with the status quo can also impede progress.\n\nFurthermore, organizations may risk getting stuck in the planning phase (aka “analysis paralysis”), struggling to transition to action. However, despite these limitations, strategic planning remains a valuable tool for organizations to set goals, navigate challenges, and adapt to change, provided it’s approached with flexibility and a realistic mindset.\n\nWhat’s more, I believe it’s valuable for planning to involve several members and to be representative of the entire organization. For example, at Near Partner, the company’s mission, vision and values were defined collaboratively with the input of all the members of the different teams. This ensures that we are all aligned in terms of objectives.\n\nStrategic planning: how to do it right\n\nTo do strategic planning right, it’s essential to follow a structured approach and consider several key factors.\n\nWhat should go into a strategic plan.\n\nSource:\n\nSME strategy\n\nHere’s\n\nhow to approach it\n\n.\n\nStart with clear goals\n\nBefore setting off on any strategic plan, gather key data on your current state – including sales and profitability figures, product or category data, market size and growth, new entrants, customer behaviour and trends. Separate what is fact (real data) from is possibly fiction (meaning forecasts or estimates). The more concrete data you gather at this stage, the more effective your strategic plan will be.\n\nOnce you’ve gathered this data, gather your team to discuss the results and figure out where do you want to be in the long run and what you aim to accomplish, like “We want to double the sales in sustainable products in three years,” and list the key initiatives to make that happen, like “We need to launch three new products this year”. Your goals will serve as the foundation for your strategic plan.\n\nPotential pitfall to avoid:\n\nproposing targets not backed by data.\n\nConduct a SWOT analysis\n\nEvery strategic plan has its roots in a thorough SWOT analysis. Check out your Strengths (what you’re great at), Weaknesses (where you could improve), Opportunities (chances to grow or expand), and Threats (things that could cause trouble). This helps in understanding the current situation and context.\n\nPotential pitfall to avoid:\n\ndoing it alone, without the inputs from your senior team.\n\nSet priorities and strategies\n\nFocus on high-impact strategies that will move the needle the most toward your objectives. For instance, this could translate into “To hit our sales goal, we’ll start an online marketing campaign, improve our website, and expand our product line.”\n\nPotential pitfall to avoid:\n\nlisting too many detailed initiatives.\n\nDevelop action plans\n\nOnce the key initiatives are defined, assign them to someone that has the gravitas to get it done and take responsibility. It is also helpful to set intermediate goals, like a monthly goal to assess the progress of that imitative. An example could be “Next month, we’ll hire a new web designer, launch the marketing campaign, and start developing the new products.”\n\nPotential pitfall to avoid:\n\nnot assigning owners to tasks and not setting intermediate goals\n\nAllocate resources wisely\n\nAllocate resources, including financial, human, and time resources, effectively to support the implementation of your strategic plan. Ensure they are aligned with your priorities and available to support key initiatives.\n\nPotential pitfall to avoid:\n\nhaving a resource plan separate from your strategy initiatives\n\nMonitor progress and adapt\n\nKeep an eye on how things are going with a formal status meeting at least every week. These meetings should focus on updating your bower chart (or any other visual tool to help you know where you stand as regards to the initial plan).\n\nStrategic bowler chart.\n\nSource\n\n:\n\nKPIFire\n\nBe prepared to adapt your plan as needed in response to changing circumstances or new information.\n\nPotential pitfall to avoid:\n\nmaking strategic planning a once-a-year thing\n\nCommunicate effectively\n\nFoster a culture of transparency and accountability to drive engagement and commitment to the plan’s success. Consider sending regular automatic email updates with progress to keep everyone informed.\n\nNear Partner, you partner for strategic planning\n\nChoosing how to put your strategy into action might feel daunting, but it doesn’t have to be. If you need help, we’re here for you with\n\nour team\n\nof experienced consultants. We can assist you in ensuring that your plan aligns with your organizational culture and is supported by the right implementation approach and resources to bring your vision to life.\n\nReach out today\n\n.\n\nStrategic Planning in Action at Near Partner\n\nAt our company, we’ve developed a strategic planning process that ensures both high-level vision and operational practicality. This process is structured around three key steps, involving the\n\nLeadership Group\n\n, the\n\nGrowth Team\n\n, and the entire organization through our all-hands meetings\n\nLeadership Group: Setting the Strategic Vision\n\nThe Leadership Group, made up of the organization’s top leaders, is responsible for the initial development of our company’s strategic plan. This group takes a high-level view, considering the internal culture, market trends, competitive positioning and long-term objectives. The group draws up the main strategic initiatives that will drive the company forward, ensuring that the plan is aligned with our mission, vision and values.\n\nGrowth Team: Refining and Enhancing the Strategy\n\nOnce the Leadership Group has drawn up a draft strategic plan, it is presented to our Growth Team to be refined. The Growth Team is made up of senior management and key individuals who have been with the company the longest, bringing a wealth of experience and institutional knowledge to the table. This team plays a key role in providing feedback, suggesting new ideas and ensuring that the strategy is feasible and grounded in the realities of our business operations.\n\nBy involving the Growth Team, we ensure that our strategic plan is not only visionary, but also practical and actionable. This collaborative approach allows us to explore different perspectives, promoting innovation and strengthening the plan before it is finalized.\n\nCompany-Wide Monthly Meeting: Sharing the Vision\n\nAfter the strategic plan is finalized, we ensure that it’s communicated effectively across the entire organization. During our\n\nall-hands meeting – Conversa de Pufes\n\n, the finalized strategy is presented to all employees.

    "content": "They’re here, they’re practical, and they are changing the way business operates. Discover how AI apps are\n\nenhancing productivity and driving innovation every day.\n\nAI apps aren’t just a trend anymore – they’re essential tools changing the game for businesses. They make work easier, simplify customer interactions, and boost efficiency. Explore how these smart solutions can help your business succeed and innovate.\n\nWhat are AI apps?\n\nAI apps, or artificial intelligence apps, are basically smart software that can do things that usually need human smarts. They use algorithms and big data to simulate learning, solving problems and making decisions. So, instead of just following a set of rules, these apps can adapt and get better over time.\n\nThey’re also great at crunching numbers and spotting trends, helping businesses make smarter decisions. Plus, as your company grows, AI apps can easily keep up with the extra workload. So, they not only increase efficiency but also make life a lot easier.\n\nWhat types of AI apps are out there?\n\nAI apps can really make a difference in how things run day-to-day:\n\nVirtual Assistants\n\n: These apps handle routine work like scheduling meetings or answering common questions, so your team can focus on bigger tasks.\n\nChatbots\n\n: Perfect for customer service,\n\nchatbots\n\ncan chat with customers, solve problems, and provide support any time of day, without needing a human on the other end.\n\nRecommendation systems\n\n: They analyse what customers like and suggest products or content that fits their tastes, which can boost sales and keep users engaged.\n\nImage and video recognition\n\n: These apps sort through photos and videos, spot defects, or even keep an eye on security, making media management and quality control a breeze.\n\nSpeech recognition\n\n: Convert spoken words into text easily, which can be great for transcribing meetings or setting up voice-activated tools.\n\nLanguage translation\n\n: Break down language barriers with real-time translation, making it simpler to communicate with international clients and partners.\n\nFinance management\n\n: Keep track of expenses, manage budgets, and get insights into financial health, helping you make smarter financial decisions.\n\nProductivity tools\n\n: From project management to writing assistance, there are apps that streamline workflows and improve team collaboration.\n\nCustomer Relationship Management\n\n: State of the art\n\nCRM systems\n\nlike Salesforce Einstein analyses customer data to provide insights and predict trends, helping you tailor your sales strategies.\n\nHow to integrate AI Apps into your business\n\nWhen bringing AI apps into your business, there are a few important things to keep in mind.\n\nClearly define your needs\n\nThere are dozens of AI apps to serve virtually every business need. Before you start searching for one, it is vital to define your requirements as best as you can. Say you need to add forecasting capability into your current stock management software or to embed AI route optimization into your logistics process – each use case has its own particular requirements, and you are likely to find very different apps to handle them. To avoid getting side tracked when browsing for tools, list your needs from the start.\n\nConsider data privacy\n\nCyberscecurity and regulatory compliance\n\nis the biggest hurdle for most companies contemplating AI integration. Check if it complies with privacy laws and regulations, like General Data Protection Regulation. You don’t want to risk sensitive information getting into the wrong hands.\n\nEvaluate the integration effort\n\nLook at how the AI app integrates with your current systems and tools. A\n\nsmooth integration\n\nmeans less hassle and fewer headaches. You want it to mesh well with what you’re already using so you can avoid disrupting your workflow.\n\nMeasure cost vs. value\n\nConsider if the cost of the AI app is worth the benefits it offers. Think about both the upfront investment and any ongoing costs. Compare these with the time and money you’ll save or the improvements you’ll see to make sure it’s a smart financial move.\n\nConsider training needs\n\nMake sure your team knows how to use the new AI app effectively. Good training is crucial; it helps everyone get up to speed quickly and ensures you’re making the most of the app’s features. Look for apps that offer user guides or training sessions if needed.\n\nEvaluate growth potential\n\nChoose an AI app that can scale with your business. As your company grows, you don’t want to outgrow your app or face limitations that slow you down. Ensure it can handle increased data or users.\n\nSee if support is available\n\nCheck what kind of support and maintenance is available. Good customer support can be a lifesaver if you run into issues or need help. Look for options like live chat, email support, or a comprehensive knowledge base.\n\nTest for accuracy\n\nTest the AI app to make sure it delivers reliable and accurate results. Run a few tests to see if it performs as expected. You want to be confident that the app’s decisions and outputs are spot on.\n\nGet user feedback\n\nGather feedback from your team and customers who interact with the AI app. Their input can help you understand how well it’s working and if any tweaks are needed. This can also help you address any issues early on.\n\nHave a fallback plan\n\nThese days, it seems like every day there is a new AI app. However, keep in mind that some of these companies will eventually fail – meaning that if you’re reliant on their work, you’ll likely face business disruptions as well. Try to get an alternative app for crucial tasks.\n\nNear Partner, customizing AI apps for every need\n\nWith over 50 thousand AI apps in the market today, selecting, integrating and (perhaps most importantly) maintaining the ones that best fit your organization is no small feat. At\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we specialize in integrating AI apps into your business flow. We take the time to understand what you need and then build a custom solution that works seamlessly with your current systems.

    "content": "All kinds of projects can easily face delays without proper project management tools.\n\nThis is how Sitetracker is keeping project managers up to date all over the world.\n\nThe\n\nfuture of work is not what it used to be\n\n. Every project manager knows the struggles of coordinating complex projects, especially when time-sensitive, first-ever, high-volume work is involved. Add absence of proper management tools to the mix and you get chaos.\n\nHere at Near Partner, we have first-hand experience in managing diverse implementation teams across multiple time zones and languages. This expertise is particularly valuable when deploying complex, high-volume projects across the globe.\n\nOne of the lessons we’ve learned along the way is that project managers need the right project management tool. Sounds simple, right? So why do so many companies still struggle to find software that can guide and connect their teams in demanding, complex, high-volume projects?\n\nOur expert tip? Meet Sitetracker.\n\nWhat is Sitetracker?\n\nSitetracker is the leading\n\nproject management solution on Salesforce\n\nand a global standard in managing high-volume projects. A cloud-based SaaS platform created for deploying, operating, and servicing critical infrastructure and technology, Sitetracker is also a serial award receiver.\n\nThis project management solution, native to the Salesforce platform, goes beyond just project management.

These search rings are farmed out to other service providers to manage these sites through real estate, engineering and construction. Vendors have access to their Sitetracker environment which is what they use to hold them accountable for hitting various milestones and manage invoicing after a completed assignment.\n\nTake Tower One Wireless. This leading owner and operator of wireless infrastructure across Canada, Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador, and the United States got in touch with Near Partner to ask for help. With Sitetracker, Tower One Wireless was able to effectively manage their sites and assets, streamline field and work operations, and leverage analytics, reporting, and integrations for enhanced performance. All with Sitetracker and a little extra boost from our team!\n\nUtility Companies\n\nUtility companies provide natural gas and electricity to a vast number of clients. They deal with installations, repairs, inspections, permit acquisition, and billing. They can either give work to service providers or they can handle the work themselves.\n\nTheir goals are getting work done by deadlines, making sure each project goes through the proper legal procedure (e.g. inspections, getting the right permits, etc.), and ultimately providing their customers with gas/electric services.\n\nA Utility Company can use Sitetracker to map out\n\nthe\n\nlocation of sites for installation/repairs, document what is required for each project (such as customer calls or permits), track assets being installed/removed on each site, use\n\nmobile\n\napp/checklists\n\nfor on-site data entry.\n\nSitetracker: Success Story with QMC\n\nQMC is a leading company in its field, managing critical infrastructure and operations. Our collaboration with QMC focused on streamlining both their sales and operational processes through the implementation of Salesforce CRM and Sitetracker, providing an integrated solution that supports the entire business workflow.\n\nWe began by focusing on the sales process. We deployed Salesforce and Sitetracker, customized to meet QMC’s specific needs. These technologies allowed the sales process to be managed with ease, automating what was once a manual process. With these tools in place, QMC could efficiently handle customer insights, business opportunities, and contract management. Data is now centralized in a structured database, allowing for better organization, automation, and visibility across the company.\n\nNext, we improved the operations process by developing a new workflow and application to support project implementation. Our solution enhanced task control, reporting, and maintenance status tracking, making operations more efficient. Additionally, we implemented a standardized onboarding process for new employees, critical for QMC’s growth. The centralized data structure not only enhances organization and security but also ensures scalability as the company continues to expand.\n\nThis successful partnership has empowered QMC to streamline both sales and operational processes, ensuring they are well-equipped to manage growth and increasing complexity in their business.\n\nHow to implement Sitetracker?\n\nSitetracker helps streamline operations in any business, maximize efficiency, and ultimately keep the entire company in sync. However, adopting a project management software is, in itself, a major project. And the bigger the company, the more complex it becomes. Therefore, businesses need to have a solid implementation process in place before rolling out the software to ensure its success.\n\nAs trusted partners of Sitetracker, we work closely with them to ensure that best practices are followed during implementation, enabling a smooth and effective adoption. Our expertise ensures that companies not only integrate the software efficiently but also leverage its full potential, driving productivity and long-term success across the organization.\n\nTo implement Sitetracker, there are a few vital steps.\n\nAssess your company’s needs\n\nBusinesses are not the same in type, size, scope, market, and so on, so most likely the needs are also going to differ from one business to the other. The first step is to assess which of Sitetracker’s products your company needs, how much customization is necessary, what are the priorities, or which plan is the best suited for your organization, for example. We have been working with both Sitetracker and Salesforce on challenging projects and can help your company get started.\n\nGet in touch with our team\n\n.\n\nPlan and prepare for launch\n\nBecause this endeavor is also a project, you will benefit from planning and making the proper adjustments before actually implementing Sitetracker. Think about a timeline, a communication plan, a software training plan, and about defining roles and responsibilities for every member of the project team. This is how we typically approach such a project and what we have done for the good folks over at QMC.\n\nHave a look at the success story\n\n.\n\nDefine an implementation stage\n\nDuring this stage, the entire company will transition from the old project management tool to the new platform. So, it is crucial to make sure that the data is being migrated, that the IT department is fully prepared, that any legacy systems integrate with Sitetracker. This is also the stage where some fine-tuning and customization might be needed. At Near Partner, we have been working with Sitetracker in a number of challenging projects around the world. Our work has led Sitetracker’s own team to rely on us for such implementations. So, if you need to upgrade your project management chops,\n\nsimply let us know.\n\nProvide proper training\n\nFinally, make sure your team has the support they need in acquiring the skills to operate Sitetracker, from the higher management to the field workers. Remember, the most expensive investment is in tools you won’t use.\n\nDo you need support to implement Sitetracker?\n\nGet in touch\n\n! Our incredible\n\nSalesforce developers\n\nare ready to provide the support you and your team need to successfully complete this project, from idea to rollout. Not only do we handle the implementation process, but we also manage ongoing, evolutionary projects to continuously optimize and enhance your Sitetracker setup.

    "content": "Generative AI is impressive, but it needs the right tools to truly shine.\n\nThat’s\n\nwhere\n\nprompt engineering steps in. Here\n\nare\n\n13\n\ntips to improve the responses you get\n\n.\n\nArtificial intelligence tools are advancing rapidly, getting closer to communicating like humans. However, if you’ve worked with AI enough, you’ve likely experienced the challenge of phrasing your queries just right to get the desired output. This becomes especially important when integrating AI into commercial applications, where outputs need to follow specific guidelines. That’s where prompt engineering comes in – crafting precise queries to optimize AI responses. But how does it work? And how can you make the most of it? Explore 13 practical tips (with examples) to improve your AI results\n\nWhat is prompt engineering?\n\nSimply put, prompt engineering is the practice of crafting inputs – known as prompts –to guide AI models, like\n\nGPT\n\n, into delivering the desired output.\n\nTo better understand this, think of AI as a highly skilled but somewhat literal-minded assistant. The way you ask it to do something determines the quality of the result you get. The same way you’d provide detailed, clear instructions to someone unfamiliar with a task, AI needs well-structured, specific input to perform well. If you’re vague or imprecise, you might get an answer that feels off-track or incomplete.\n\nSo, prompt engineering is about asking the right questions in the right way. The more you understand how to structure these inputs, the more powerful the AI’s responses become.\n\nWhy your business needs prompt engineering?\n\nIn a world where AI is becoming the go-to solution for everything from customer service to content creation,\n\nprompt engineering could be one of the secrets for taking your business to the next level\n\n. Here’s why you should care about it.\n\nImproves accuracy and relevance\n\nWhen you use well-crafted prompts, you help AI deliver outputs that make sense for what you need. This means better decisions and more effective use of AI.\n\nUse case\n\n: A marketing agency tunes its prompts for a content generator. By specifying details about their target audience, they consistently get high-quality articles that hit the mark, cutting down on editing time.\n\nEnhances customer experience\n\nWith effective prompt engineering, you can create AI solutions that feel personal to your customers. Tailoring responses based on user input can ramp up\n\ncustomer satisfaction\n\n.\n\nUse case\n\n: An e-commerce site rolls out a chatbot that uses prompt engineering to assist shoppers. By refining how it responds, the\n\nchatbot\n\noffers personalized product suggestions and resolves questions quickly, leading to happy customers and more sales.\n\nIncreases efficiency and saves time\n\nSmart prompts can save you time by reducing the need for back-and-forth revisions. This means your team can focus on what really matters instead of getting bogged down in edits.\n\nUse case\n\n: A financial firm automates its report generation using AI and prompt engineering. By defining exactly what analyses they need, the AI cranks out accurate financial summaries way faster than before, freeing analysts to work on strategy.\n\nFacilitates complex problem-solving\n\nWhen tasks get complicated, prompt engineering helps break them down into manageable pieces. This is handy in industries where details matter.\n\nUse case\n\n: In\n\nhealthcare\n\n, a diagnostic tool leverages prompt engineering to interpret patient data. By guiding the AI to focus on specific symptoms and histories, it assists doctors in making accurate diagnoses.\n\nDrives innovation\n\nWith prompt engineering, you can unlock exciting new capabilities for your AI. This can lead to fresh ideas and unique offerings that set you apart in the market.\n\nUse case\n\n: A tech startup creates a language translation tool that gets better with user feedback, thanks to prompt engineering. By refining prompts based on what users say, the tool becomes more accurate and gives the startup a leg up on the competition.\n\nEnables scalability\n\nAs your business grows, prompt engineering helps your AI solutions scale smoothly. This flexibility is key if you want to expand without losing quality.\n\nUse case\n\n: A global company uses prompt engineering to develop a customer support system that can handle multiple languages. By fine-tuning prompts for different languages, they effectively manage support inquiries worldwide.\n\nHow does prompt engineering work?\n\nGenerative AI models, like GPT, are trained on massive datasets and rely on complex neural networks to process and respond to prompts. At the heart of how they function is a blend of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.\n\nWhen a prompt is given, the model breaks down the input through a process known as\n\ntokenization\n\n. This involves converting the text into smaller units (tokens), which the AI can analyse. These tokens help the model recognize patterns, meaning, and context within the input, allowing it to predict and generate coherent responses.\n\nA range of techniques can influence how the model generates output. For instance,\n\nmodel parameter tuning\n\nadjusts the internal settings of the AI to control factors like creativity or precision. Another method,\n\ntop-k sampling\n\n, limits the number of possible next-word predictions, helping to create more focused and relevant responses. These techniques work together to refine the outputs based on the input, ensuring the AI delivers more precise, creative, or contextually appropriate results.\n\nGenerative models like DALL-E, which create images from text prompts, add another layer of complexity. These models use a technique called\n\nstable diffusion\n\n, which works alongside the language model to transform text into visual outputs. Here too, prompt engineering is vital for directing the model toward producing high-quality images that match the description.\n\nWhat are the benefits of prompt engineering?\n\nThe main advantage of prompt engineering is that it helps AI models generate\n\nhigh-quality responses\n\nwith minimal need for editing or adjustments afterward. AI outputs can vary in quality, and without a well-crafted prompt, you might end up spending more time fixing the output than benefiting from it. By using precise and targeted prompts, prompt engineers can guide the AI to produce responses that align closely with the desired outcome, reducing the amount of post-processing required.\n\nAnother huge benefit is how prompt engineering can make interactions with AI\n\nmore efficient over time\n\n. As AI systems adapt and evolve, having a well-engineered prompt from the start can\n\nstreamline long-term workflows\n\n. Whether you’re using AI to generate reports, answer customer inquiries, or even create stories, prompt engineering ensures that each interaction becomes more productive and satisfying.\n\nThe more complex and capable these systems become, the more important it is to guide them effectively to get the best results.\n\n13 tips to generate better results (with examples)\n\nWith these 13 tips, you can dramatically improve the quality and relevance of AI-generated content.\n\nBe clear and specific\n\nOne of the simplest but most powerful strategies in prompt engineering is clarity. AI models thrive on clear, direct instructions. The more specific you are with what you want, the better the AI can deliver relevant and useful results. Of course, writing clear instructions takes time and knowledge but overly vague prompts often result in broad or imprecise outputs, which may require further refinement or editing.\n\n❌\n\nWorse\n\nWrite about health benefits.\n\nOuput: There are many health benefits, like better heart health and more energy.\n\n✅\n\nBetter\n\nList five health benefits of a Mediterranean diet, focusing on heart health and longevity.\n\nOutput: The Mediterranean diet offers several benefits, including: 1) Lower risk of heart disease, 2) Improved cholesterol levels, 3) Reduced inflammation, 4) Enhanced brain function, 5) Increased life expectancy.\n\nProvide context\n\nContext is crucial for generating meaningful responses. AI models can generate better, more coherent results when they have enough context to understand what you’re asking. Context can include background information, specific instructions, or even a scenario that frames the prompt.\n\nFor example, if you’re using AI to write an email, providing context about who the recipient is, what the email is about, and the tone you want (e.g., formal or friendly) can lead to a much more tailored response.\n\n❌\n\nWorse\n\nWrite an email about a new product launch.\n\nOuput: We have a new product coming out.\n\nStay tuned!\n\n✅\n\nBetter\n\nWrite an email to our existing customers announcing the launch of our new eco-friendly water bottle. The tone should be friendly and excited, and mention a special 10% discount for early buyers.\n\nOutput: Hi [Customer]! We’re thrilled to announce the launch of our newest product – an eco-friendly water bottle made from sustainable materials! As a valued customer, we’re offering you an exclusive 10% discount for early purchases.\n\nGrab yours now and help reduce plastic waste!\n\n.\n\nEmbrace AI personas\n\nOne powerful strategy in prompt engineering is to have the AI adopt a specific persona or role. By guiding the AI to respond from a defined perspective, you can obtain insights and opinions that reflect the expertise or viewpoint of that persona. This approach allows for richer, more nuanced responses, especially when you’re seeking specialized knowledge or a particular take on an issue.\n\nWhen crafting your prompt, simply instruct the AI to “act as” a certain expert or character.\n\n❌\n\nGeneral prompt\n\nWhat are the benefits of renewable energy?\n\nOuput: Renewable energy sources are beneficial because they reduce carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels.\n\n✅\n\nPrompt with persona\n\nAct as a renewable energy expert and explain the benefits of renewable energy.\n\nOutput:\n\nAs a renewable energy expert, I can tell you that the benefits are substantial. Not only do renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions, but they also promote energy independence and create jobs in emerging technologies. Furthermore, they help stabilize energy prices in the long run.\n\nRefine your questions\n\nSometimes, you might find yourself unsure about how to articulate your query effectively. In such cases, a helpful strategy is to ask the AI for assistance in refining your question. This approach can clarify your thoughts and lead to more targeted and insightful responses.\n\nWhen using this strategy, you can prompt the AI to suggest a better version of your initial question or to help you frame it in a more effective way.\n\n❌\n\nInitial prompt\n\nTell me about renewable energy.\n\nOuput: Renewable energy includes sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.\n\n✅\n\nPrompt for refinement\n\nHow do I ask you about the benefits of renewable energy in a better way?\n\nOutput:\n\nYou might ask: ‘What are the key advantages of using renewable energy sources compared to fossil fuels?” This will lead to a more detailed and focused response.\n\nLet the AI take the lead\n\nAnother effective strategy in prompt engineering is to allow the AI to guide the conversation towards achieving a specific goal or task. By inviting the AI to ask you questions, you can create a more interactive dialogue that helps clarify your needs and enables the AI to deliver more relevant and effective results.\n\nThis approach leverages the AI’s ability to think critically and utilize its knowledge base to identify the key information required for the task at hand. Instead of providing all the details upfront, you can prompt the AI to inquire further, ensuring that it fully understands your objectives.\n\n❌\n\nInitial prompt\n\nHelp me create a marketing plan.\n\nOuput: Sure! Could you provide details about your target audience?\n\n✅\n\nPrompt for AI-led conversation\n\nAsk me questions until you have all the information you need to create a marketing plan.\n\nOutput:\n\nGreat! First, what is your main goal for this marketing plan – are you looking to increase brand awareness, drive sales, or something else? Also, what budget do you have in mind?\n\nRequest supporting facts\n\nWhen diving into a topic you’re not familiar with, it’s always a good idea to ask the AI for the facts behind its responses. By requesting a list of supporting information alongside the output, you can verify the accuracy of what you’re being told and ensure that the AI isn’t basing its conclusions on incorrect assumptions.\n\nThis strategy is especially helpful when you have limited knowledge about a subject but still want to make informed decisions or gain insights.\n\n❌\n\nInitial prompt\n\nWhat are the benefits of meditation?\n\nOuput: Meditation can reduce stress, improve concentration, and promote emotional health.\n\n✅\n\nPrompt for AI-led conversation\n\nWhat are the benefits of meditation? Whenever you give me an answer, include a list of facts that support it.\n\nOutput:\n\nSure! Here are some supporting facts: 1) Studies show that meditation can lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol, 2) Research indicates that regular meditation practice can enhance focus and attention span, and 3) A review of multiple studies found that meditation contributes to greater emotional well-being by reducing anxiety and depression.\n\nExplore the AI’s reasoning\n\nWhen you receive an answer from the AI, it can be really insightful to ask how it reached that conclusion. By prompting the AI to explain its reasoning, you can gain a better understanding of the thought process behind its responses.\n\n❌\n\nInitial prompt\n\nWhat are the benefits of exercise?\n\nOuput: Exercise can boost your mood, improve your physical health, and enhance cognitive function.\n\n✅\n\nPrompt for reasoning\n\nWhat are the benefits of exercise? Whenever you give me an answer, explain how you reached that conclusion.\n\nOutput:\n\nSure! To come up with that answer, I considered various studies that show the effects of exercise on mental health, such as how physical activity increases endorphins, which can lead to a better mood. I also referenced research linking regular exercise to reduced risks of chronic diseases and improvements in brain health, particularly regarding memory and focus.\n\nExperiment with temperature and top-k sampling\n\nGenerative AI models like GPT often have parameters that allow you to control the creativity and randomness of the output. Two common settings are temperature and top-k sampling.\n\nTemperature\n\ncontrols how “creative” or varied the AI’s responses are. A low temperature (close to 0) makes the AI more conservative and focused, while a higher temperature (closer to 1) increases creativity but can also introduce more randomness.\n\nTop-k sampling\n\nlimits the number of potential next-word predictions the AI can choose from. By reducing this number, you can make the AI’s output more predictable and relevant to your prompt.\n\n❌\n\nWorse\n\nLow temperature (0.2): Describe a cozy winter evening.\n\nOuput: A cozy winter evening is spent inside, with a warm blanket, a crackling fire, and a hot cup of cocoa.\n\n✅\n\nBetter\n\nLow temperature (0.9): Describe a cozy winter evening.\n\nOutput: A cozy winter evening might include twinkling lights, the faint smell of cinnamon, laughter echoing through a cabin, and snow falling gently outside.\n\nBreak down complex tasks\n\nWhen dealing with complex queries, breaking the task down into smaller, more manageable pieces can improve the quality of the output. Large, multi-part prompts can overwhelm the AI, leading to generic or inaccurate responses. Instead of asking one large question, divide it into simpler, step-by-step instructions.\n\nFor example, instead of asking the AI to summarize a full report in one go, start by asking it to summarize individual sections. Then, you can ask it to combine the smaller summaries into a concise overall description.\n\n❌\n\nComplex prompt\n\nSummarize the entire research paper on climate change mitigation strategies.\n\nOuput: The paper discusses various strategies for mitigating climate change, including renewable energy, carbon capture, and sustainable practices.\n\n✅\n\nBroken-down prompt\n\n1)\n\nSummarize the introduction of the paper on climate change mitigation strategies.\n\nThe introduction outlines the urgent need for climate change mitigation, emphasizing the global rise in greenhouse gases and the role of renewable energy in reducing emissions.\n\n2) Summarize the conclusion of the paper on climate change mitigation strategies.\n\nThe conclusion highlights the importance of international cooperation and long-term sustainability practices to achieve significant reductions in global carbon emissions.\n\nBy breaking down the task, you get a more detailed and structured response, which can later be combined for a comprehensive overview.\n\nExperiment with tone and style\n\nGenerative AI models can adjust their tone and style based on how you phrase the prompt, which is particularly useful when writing for different audiences. Experimenting with tone allows you to customize outputs for specific contexts – whether you need something formal, casual, humorous, or technical.\n\n❌\n\nNeutral tone\n\nExplain how solar panels work.\n\nOuput: Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity through a process called the photovoltaic effect. Photons from the sun knock electrons loose in solar cells, creating an electric current.\n\n✅\n\nPersonalized tone\n\n1) Casual tone\n\nHey, how do solar panels actually work?\n\nSo, solar panels are these cool devices that turn sunlight into electricity. Basically, when sunlight hits them, it shakes up electrons in the cells, and boom, you’ve got power.\n\n2) Formal tone\n\nProvide a detailed explanation of how solar panels generate electricity.\n\nSolar panels function by harnessing sunlight through the photovoltaic effect, wherein photons from the sun’s rays dislodge electrons within semiconductor materials, resulting in the generation of an electric current that can be utilized for power.\n\nI\n\nn addition\n\n, i\n\nnstead of\n\nadjusting\n\nthe wording of your prompt to imply a tone, you can simply specify the tone or style directly\n\n, such as “e\n\nxplain how solar panels work in a casual tone\n\n” or “e\n\nxplain how solar panels work in a formal tone\n\n”\n\n.\n\nIterate and refine\n\nAI is powerful, but it’s not perfect. Often, you won’t get the exact result you’re looking for on the first try. This is where iteration comes into play. By slightly tweaking your prompts and refining them, you can guide the AI closer to your desired output. You might start with a general question, see what the AI produces, and then refine your prompt based on what worked or didn’t.\n\n❌\n\nFirst prompt\n\nDescribe a beautiful sunset.\n\nOuput: The sky turned orange as the sun set over the horizon.\n\n✅\n\nRefined prompt\n\nDescribe a breathtaking sunset over the ocean, focusing on the colours in the sky and the reflection on the water.\n\nOutput: The sun dipped below the ocean, casting brilliant shades of pink, purple, and gold across the sky, while the calm water mirrored the vibrant colours in a breathtaking display.\n\nUse examples\n\nSometimes the best way to get what you want from an AI is by giving it a direct example of the type of response you’re looking for. This is especially useful for complex or nuanced tasks where the AI may struggle to interpret your needs. By providing examples of both “good” and “bad” outputs, you give the AI a reference point for the kind of results you expect.\n\n❌\n\nPrompt without an example\n\nWrite a product description for a luxury watch.\n\nOuput: This watch is elegant and stylish.\n\n✅\n\nPrompt with examples\n\nWrite a product description for a luxury watch. Example: “Crafted with precision, this watch features a sapphire crystal face and a gold-plated case, exuding timeless elegance.”\n\nOutput: This luxury watch combines exquisite craftsmanship with modern design. Featuring a sleek sapphire crystal face and a hand-polished gold case, it’s a statement piece for those who appreciate the finer things in life.\n\nGuide with constraints\n\nAdding constraints to your prompt is a great way to focus the AI’s output and avoid results that are too long, short, or vague. You can specify word counts, formatting requirements, or even the tone of the response. This allows you to tailor the AI’s output to fit your needs, whether you’re writing an article, generating product descriptions, or even creating dialogue for a chatbot.\n\n❌\n\nPrompt without constraints\n\nWrite a summary of the benefits of exercise.\n\nOuput: Exercise has many benefits. It can improve your health, make you feel better, and help you stay in shape.\n\n✅\n\nPrompt with constraints\n\nWrite a 100-word summary of the physical and mental benefits of daily exercise, using a formal tone.\n\nOutput: Daily exercise offers numerous physical benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and weight management. It also enhances mental well-being by reducing stress, improving mood, and boosting cognitive function. Regular physical activity is key to maintaining both physical and mental health.\n\nNear Partner, your partner for prompt engineering\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we can help you develop clear and specific prompts that ensure your AI provides accurate responses tailored to your project needs.

    "content": "Learn how Salesforce DevOps can give your business a serious upgrade.\n\nWorried about the next big update to your mission-critical business applications? Salesforce DevOps is transforming how companies handle deployments—large or small—by making updates easier and reducing risk. Discover how Salesforce DevOps can impact your business, streamline changes, and why adopting a strategic DevOps approach could be the key to keeping your apps running at peak performance.\n\nWhat exactly is Salesforce DevOps?\n\nAt its core, DevOps combines\n\ndevelopment\n\n(Dev) and\n\noperations\n\n(Ops). It’s a set of practices designed to bring development and IT teams together, focusing on automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement. While DevOps isn’t unique to Salesforce, Salesforce DevOps has tailored practices and tools that fit the\n\nSalesforce ecosystem\n\n, making it easier to update, improve, and scale your Salesforce environment in line with business needs.\n\nIn the context of Salesforce, DevOps focuses on accelerating the development and deployment of new features or updates while minimizing downtime or disruptions. It’s about getting things done faster and with greater reliability, which it vital in today’s competitive environment where any hiccup in your CRM can cost you opportunities.\n\nWhy your business should invest in Salesforce DevOps\n\nSalesforce DevOps can give your business a strategic edge.\n\nSpeed matters\n\nWhen there’s a big change, customers expect quick responses, seamless updates, and new features. By investing in Salesforce DevOps, you’re giving your team the tools to deliver changes faster than ever.\n\nAutomated testing\n\nSalesforce DevOps allows you to implement automated testing and\n\ncontinuous integration\n\n, which means your updates are more reliable, just like a safety net that catches mistakes before they reach your users. With fewer errors and smoother releases, your customers will have a better experience.\n\nFuture-proofing your business\n\nAs your company grows, so do your processes and needs. By adopting DevOps now, you’re setting up a solid foundation to handle increased complexity down the road. You’ll be better equipped to adapt to changes, whether that’s scaling your operations or integrating new technologies. This proactive approach helps you stay ahead of the curve and ready for whatever comes next.\n\nKey components of Salesforce DevOps\n\nLet’s go over the main components that bring Salesforce DevOps to life:\n\n1. Version control\n\nVersion control is the backbone of any DevOps practice, especially in Salesforce. It allows teams to track changes in code across multiple projects, ensuring there’s a backup if something goes wrong and giving everyone visibility into who made which changes and why. This keeps your team aligned and reduces confusion.\n\n2. Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)\n\nIn DevOps, CI ensures that code changes are automatically tested, catching errors before they make it to production. CD, meanwhile, automates the deployment of tested code, making it easy to release features continuously without the risk of downtime.\n\n3. Automated testing\n\nAutomated tests run scripts that check for common issues and ensure that new changes don’t interfere with existing functionalities. This means your users get a seamless experience without disruptions.\n\n4. Monitoring and logging\n\nWith monitoring tools, DevOps allows you to track the performance of your Salesforce environment and identify issues in real time. Log management helps teams review issues after the fact, providing insight into what went wrong and helping prevent it from happening again. This proactive approach helps resolve issues faster.\n\nBest practices for implementing Salesforce DevOps\n\nIf you’re considering Salesforce DevOps, here are some tips to get started:\n\nCommunication is key\n\nMake sure your development and operations teams are talking to each other regularly. Regular check-ins, stand-up meetings, or even a casual coffee chat can do wonders for ensuring everyone is on the same page. When everyone knows what’s happening, it’s easier to spot issues before they become big problems.\n\nEmbrace automation\n\nAutomated testing\n\nand deployment processes will save you time and effort while reducing the risk of errors. Plus, automated testing helps catch bugs early, making your releases smoother and more reliable.\n\nStart small and iterate\n\nIf you try to overhaul everything at once, it can feel overwhelming. Instead, focus on one or two processes you want to improve, and gradually expand from there. This way, you can learn as you go and adjust based on what works best for your team.\n\nLeverage feedback loops\n\nAfter every deployment, take the time to gather feedback from your team and stakeholders. What worked well? What could have gone better? This feedback is gold – it helps you identify areas for improvement and celebrate the wins. Plus, it keeps the lines of communication open.\n\nInvest in training and resources\n\nGive your team the tools they need to succeed – workshops, online courses, or simply access to the latest DevOps tools. Just make sure your team is equipped with the right knowledge and skills – it will pay off in the long run. A well-trained team is a confident team, and confidence leads to better outcomes.\n\nCommon challenges in Salesforce DevOps and how to overcome them\n\nSalesforce DevOps, while transformative, can come with a unique set of challenges that businesses need to manage carefully.\n\nChange management\n\nDevOps represents a significant shift in how teams work and collaborate, requiring both a mindset shift and adjustments in day-to-day processes. Introducing this change requires well-thought-out training programs, ensuring that everyone involved, from developers to operations staff, understands not only the technical aspects of DevOps but also the collaborative culture it requires.\n\nResistance to change is natural, but providing ample resources, ongoing support, and clear communication around the benefits can help teams adapt more smoothly.\n\nTool integration\n\nWith so many specialized DevOps tools for Salesforce on the market, selecting the right one can be daunting. Many organizations find that integrating these tools into an existing Salesforce setup isn’t always straightforward. Compatibility issues or customization needs can complicate the process, so it’s essential to conduct thorough evaluations before choosing a solution. Investing time upfront to understand each tool’s capabilities and how they align with your specific Salesforce needs can prevent headaches down the line.\n\nStriking a balance between speed and quality\n\nIn DevOps, there’s also an emphasis on speed – getting features, updates, and fixes out rapidly to stay competitive. However, this speed can sometimes come at the expense of quality if not properly managed. Striking a\n\nbalance between speed and quality\n\nis crucial; while continuous integration and deployment pipelines allow for rapid releases, testing should never be overlooked. Automated testing is a valuable practice here, ensuring that every new feature or update is vetted thoroughly before reaching production.\n\nGetting started with Salesforce DevOps\n\nif you’re looking to get started with Salesforce DevOps, partnering with an expert like\n\nNear Partner\n\ncan make all the difference. We’ll help you design a DevOps strategy that fits your Salesforce setup perfectly.\n\nLet’s chat\n\n!",

    "content": "efficiency, communication and growth. This is what “they” can do for you.\n\nChatbots came a very long way from their humble beginnings as simple conversation simulators. A few years ago, you’d be lucky to get a coherent response from pre-determined keywords and prompts (remember Facebook’s early pre-set responses?). Today, they can analyse spreadsheets, generate complex email responses tailored to customer data, and save countless hours in repetitive, manual tasks. Furthermore, they can detect patterns and issues that are not obvious to humans, thanks to innovations from Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Deep Learning.\n\nWhat is a chatbot?\n\nIn broad terms, chatbot is any software that imitates human-like communication with a user in a chat. They can engage a potential customer in a conversation, capture their contacts, deal with queries or introduce your service by telling about its main features.\n\nGlobal chatbot market size.\n\nSource:\n\nPredence research\n\nChatbots can range from simple, rule-based systems that respond to specific commands with pre-defined answers, to more advanced AI-driven bots that can understand natural language and generate responses that mimic human-like conversations.\n\nChatbots are used in a variety of applications, such as customer service, information retrieval, and even for entertainment purposes. They can be integrated into websites, internal apps, messaging apps, and social media platforms to provide users with immediate responses to queries, guidance, or assistance. The technology behind them continues to evolve, making interactions more seamless and enabling them to handle more complex conversations.\n\nA brief history of Chatbots\n\nThe first ever chatbot was named\n\nELIZA\n\n. Created in 1966 at the MIT, ELIZA, then called “chatterbot”, was designed to simulate a Rogerian therapist – that is, to provide empathic responses to users’ inputs. It relied on a technique called pattern matching, where it would detect certain keywords and respond accordingly. For example, if a user said to ELIZA that they were depressed, the chatbot would reply something like “I am sorry you feel that way.”\n\nA few years later, in the early 70’s, PARRY ushered in a new era for medical chatbots. PARRY simulated a person with paranoid schizophrenia and was used by medical students to learn to communicate with patients. After that, chatbots became increasingly sophisticated, and soon enough came Racter (1983), a chatbot that generated random English prose,\n\nDr. Sabaitso\n\n(1991), another psychologist chatbot, and a multitude of conversationalist chatbots like\n\nA.L.I.C.E.\n\n(1995),\n\nJabbewacky\n\n(1997),\n\nCleverbot\n\n(2008), introduced the technology to a wider audience.\n\nChatbot landscape.\n\nSource:\n\nMicope\n\nThe 2010’s brought advancements in Machine Learning, which made it possible to create chatbots that could “learn” from data, and do simple tasks like book appointments, process orders, or even assist with simpler customer service issues. The rise of AI propelled them forward. We now have at our disposal weather bots, news bots, bots to help with ordering groceries, personal finance bots, scheduling bots, therapy bots, and even life advice bots or friendship bots.\n\nWhat kinds of chatbots are there?\n\nThere are, essentially, two types of chatbots:\n\nRules-Based Chatbots:\n\nRules-based chatbots rely on pre-defined sets of rules and keywords to respond to user queries. These are also called decision-tree chatbots, and they usually deliver pre-programmed responses, for example in the form of a menu. These have greatly evolved over the years, and are still widely used, for example, in customer service by airlines, banks, e-commerce, or the hospitality sector. They are simple and easy to implement, and while they are generally quite secure – as they follow a script – they struggle with more complex queries.\n\nAI-Powered Chatbots:\n\nnow this is where things get more interesting. AI-powered chatbots leverage Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing to handle complicated queries from users. AI chatbots “learn” from user interactions and are able to tailor their responses to the specific user. These chatbots can be used in customer service, but also for education and training, for healthcare, for marketing and sales, for HR purposes, or for internal operations.\n\nFinally, chatbots can also be hybrid, meaning they can be AI-powered but follow a rules-based approached.\n\nChatbot benefits\n\nChatbots are rapidly changing the way businesses operate. So, what can it do for your business, concretely?\n\nAutomating repetitive tasks:\n\nChatbots can easily handle queries like password resets and software troubleshooting, HR queries such as leave requests or PTO, and administrative tasks such as scheduling meetings, booking meeting rooms, and generating expense reports. Freeing your employees from these time-consuming tasks, allows them to focus on other projects that effectively require human intervention.\n\nKnowledge Base Management:\n\nChatbots can act as on-demand knowledge bases, providing users with easy access to information, in a conversational way. Chatbots can retrieve information easily from centralised repositories be it for company procedures, policies, and best practices, for product specs and pricing, software troubleshooting guides, FAQs, and many more.\n\nOn-The-Job Training\n\n: Chatbots can guidemployees through various processes, best practices, and compliance measures. Additionally, chatbots can offer bite-sized training modules and answer specific job-related questions, provide ongoing support and micro-learning opportunities, ensuring your team stays up-to-date without the need for extensive onboarding processes, or intensive education sessions.\n\nI\n\nmproved Communication and Collaboration\n\n: Chatbots can mediate between teams, departments, and customers. They facilitate messaging, schedule meetings, and improve knowledge sharing, helping cultivate more collaborative and connected work environments.\n\nPersonalized Support:\n\nUsers can use chatbots as on-demand support systems for guidance and recommendations. An internal chatbot can help an employee solve a problem on a task, navigate a new software, or even fetch similar past issues from the knowledge-base.\n\nFeedback:\n\nEverybody knows feedback is key. Chatbots can be implemented as anonymous feedback channels, through which users can report issues, share suggestions, or raise concerns without pressure. This feedback provides valuable insights to improve processes and the overall experience.\n\nData Collection and Analysis:\n\nChatbots can process vast amounts of data to identify trends, potential risks, workflow bottlenecks, opportunities for improvement, and others, and provide insights.\n\nReduced Operating Costs:\n\nBy greatly reducing the tedious administrative burden, internal chatbots can contribute to significant cost savings. The more streamlined the operations, the more resources available to invest in strategic growth initiatives.\n\nHow to implement Chatbots in your business\n\nThe story of chatbots is still being written, and AI is yet another chapter. As technology continues to evolve, we can expect chatbots to become even more sophisticated, blurring the lines between human and machine interaction and further revolutionising the way we work and live. But, although chatbots can seem like real\n\ndo-alls\n\n, implementing chatbots seamlessly into your existing workflows requires careful planning. Here are some steps to consider:\n\nWhat does your business need from a chatbot?\n\nIs it automation of menial tasks, improved communication, progress tracking, knowledge base management? It is important to know what your business’ needs are.\n\nWhat is the chatbot’s purpose?\n\nHaving a clearly defined purpose for your chatbot ensures it can be programmed to offer targeted support and excel at that, rather than becoming a catch-all for miscellaneous queries.\n\nPre-built or from-scratch?\n\nThere are dozens, if not hundreds, of chatbots dedicated to pretty much anything you can think of. Is there any that can suit your business’ needs? Do you need to have it built from scratch? Are you using a platform that offers integrated AI chatbots?\n\nWho will be using it?\n\nChatbot implementation depends on who will use it. For employees who don’t have technical expertise, the priority should be a conversational interface and general user-friendliness.\n\nNot sure how to proceed?

    "content": "Digital transformation poses a complex array of challenges. Businesses around the world are turning to low-code to streamline processes and reduce Time to Market.\n\nTag along for a journey back in time. Remember that blissful age before COVID-19? Then it happened.\n\nBusinesses that were almost exclusively offline suddenly had to digitize operations. Some were not the least bit prepared. As if moving workers to\n\nwork-from-home\n\npositions wasn’t challenging enough,\n\nteam communication\n\nhad to be revised. Product development was put on hold. And the Time to Market of innovations increased.\n\nAt the same time, peoples’ lives changed, meaning businesses had to adapt, fast. The strain on digital platforms grew, and IT teams felt the pressure.\n\nCOVID-19 soon became the biggest driver of digital transformation in recent years\n\n. The pandemic triggered a profound shift in the way companies work. Business leaders found themselves under intense pressure to cope.\n\nSo, how did savvy companies respond?\n\nEnter Low-code\n\nFast forward to today.\n\nCompanies are rediscovering low-code, a software development approach that enables the delivery of applications faster and with minimal hand-coding.\n\nLow-code platforms are a collection of tools that enable the visual development of applications through a graphical interface. They enable developers to skip hand-coding, speeding up the process of getting an application to production.\n\nBy\n\nOutSystems\n\nLow-code isn’t as new as you might think\n\nHowever revolutionary, low-code is not a new concept. In computing years, some might even call it ancient.\n\nIf you worked in IT in the 1980s or 1990s, chances are someone pitched you a solution that promised to offload much of the demand for new applications to the users themselves. The grandfathers of low-code were computer-assisted software engineering (CASE) tools and early rapid application development (RAD) tools.\n\nOutSystems, the first low-code platform for application development, was founded in 2001 by founder Paulo Rosado, amidst a tech bubble burst and a catastrophe such as 9/11. The goal? Take on the likes of SAP and Oracle. No easy feat, especially when you consider the facts of that year, but OutSystems powered through to\n\nraise $1 M that very same year\n\n.\n\nHowever, the dream to tickle tech giants has become more realist in recent years, as low-code truly gained traction. For 2030, Forrester expects the low-code industry as a whole\n\nto be worth an estimate $B 187\n\n. OutSystems\n\nalone has a market cap of $30 billion\n\n, with more than 300 partners, including – you guessed it – us, here at Near Partner.\n\n“Low-code” has become something of a buzzword. But what does it mean exactly?\n\nWhat Low-code actually means\n\nLow-code is an innovative approach to\n\nsoftware development that involves minimal hand coding\n\n. Instead, low-code relies in visual development of apps through a graphic and intuitive interface.\n\nBy\n\nOutSystems\n\nThis means almost anyone with a basic understanding of how software works can now “program” apps, websites, or back office apps.\n\nImplementing low-code is revolutionising the way businesses operate, as it enables the software that usually took weeks or months to code and test to be deployed in a matter of days or hours, in some cases. Concepts turn into realities faster, drastically reducing Time to Market.\n\nWhat is Time to Market, you ask?\n\nWhy businesses should care about Time to Market\n\nTime to Market is the\n\ntime it takes to go from initial idea to finished product\n\n– whether that is a product, a website, or an app.\n\nResearch has shown that new market entrants enjoy clear advantages in terms of market share, revenue, and sales growth. That makes Time to Market one of the essential product development KPIs or metrics – and a top priority for business leaders.\n\nA project such as building a fully functional website for an already-existing business in the traditional way can take somewhere between three months to almost a year – depending on the business needs.\n\nOn top of that traditional development is pretty much restricted to skilled teams with in-depth coding knowledge. Low-code, on the other hand, is much more inclusive. It allows business users from all departments to get actively involved in the development and design of their apps, avoiding common pitfalls in app development that happen when there’s a big separation between the IT department and the rest of the business.\n\nTime to Market is also significantly decreased, with the total timeline, from conception to deployment, ranging from a couple of months to a couple of weeks.\n\nHow low-code is changing businesses’ Time to Market\n\nEveryone can learn code 101\n\nTo be able to make decisions regarding low-code programming, you do not need a computer science masters’ degree. One of the ways the adoption of low-code helps speed Time to Market is that all team members can actively participate in application design, with little to no coding skills.\n\nThe simple interface and intuitive design of low-code platforms streamline the process. Suddenly, designing applications becomes widespread across the organization: what if basic programming became as commonplace as creating a spreadsheet or a presentation deck?\n\nOf course, changes, fine-tuning and overall customisation will need an experienced pair of hands and a low-code-trained brain, but the foundation can absolutely be laid by anyone in the team. This is where a digital transformation partner like Near Partner can help your business grow. Each solution is tailored to your needs, and a team of highly skilled individuals will build on what you already have to make scalable and secure.\n\nIf you’re looking of ways of upskilling your developing team, start with\n\nthese 5 essential Software Engineer skills, according to CIOs.\n\nCustomer feedback can be quickly embodied\n\nCustomer and client feedback is a precious resource for all kinds of businesses. That’s why, when a business manages to get feedback, the smart thing to do is to listen and act accordingly.\n\nBy using a low-code platform, changes can be quickly implemented without having to rely heavily on the IT department.\n\nIt’s all about what drives company culture. At Near Partner,\n\neverything we do revolves around customer needs\n\n. Back in 2017, before we even had a name, we knew customer centricity was essential, as well as empathy, mutual help, and kindness to each other.\n\nThat is what Culture means to us, whether we’re working on a project, having a “Pouf Talk”, laughing at lunch, or fighting it out at a Ping-Pong game.\n\nTesting gets easier\n\nTesting new concepts can represent a huge chunk of the time spent developing an application, which ultimately slows down the Time to Market. Proper testing isn’t done overnight, and meanwhile the businesses can’t deliver – increasing Time to Market and adding costs.\n\nWith low-code, unit testing is dramatically reduced. Why? All the testing is done beforehand, since low-code platforms offer ready-to-use modules with all the respective functionalities up and running.\n\nBy\n\nOutSystems\n\nWhat if you want custom coding additions? Some unit testing might be needed then, but the cloud-based environment simplifies and streamlines testing even further.\n\nModular solutions enable iterative evolution\n\nExpanding the functionalities of a website or application is also made easier with low-code. Its modular nature allows for iterative expansion and evolution, functionality-adding and, most importantly, it doesn’t affect the main website or app, or the Time to Market.\n\nWhile the central part of the business continues to run smoothly, different departments can work on the expansion without disrupting the “business as usual”.\n\nLow-code can help your business face today’s challenges and prepare for tomorrow’s. Streamlining development, integration, and deployment of applications helps drive business value, as it cuts back on development time, costs, and ultimately, Time to Market.\n\nNo more rogue IT\n\nIn large organizations, rogue IT or shadow IT refers to solutions deployed by departments other than the central IT department, to work around the shortcomings of the central information systems. Excel macros are the most common examples and represent around 19% of all rogue IT applications.\n\nRogue IT can be a barrier to innovation because it blocks the establishment of more efficient work processes. It is also a waste of time: since most “developers” of rogue IT actually work in HR, finance or marketing, development usually takes longer only to end up not being scalable to other departments. Also, usually it doesn’t comply with cybersecurity best practices.\n\nSolution? Low-code allows users to create apps in different departments with an embedded single set of previously agreed-upon rules.\n\nRapid prototyping, faster launches\n\nLow-code platforms enable businesses to whip up prototypes in a flash. Instead of months of development time, you can sketch out ideas, build prototypes, and launch MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) in weeks or even days, rather than months.\n\nAgile adaptation to market trends\n\nWith low-code, businesses can quickly adapt to changing\n\nmarket trends\n\nand customer needs. Whether it’s adding new features, rolling out updates, or pivoting your entire strategy, low-code gives you the agility to move at the speed of business.\n\nEffortless integration across platforms\n\nSay goodbye to the headache of integrating unrelated systems and applications. Low-code platforms come with built-in integrations and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that make connecting to external services a breeze. Whether you’re syncing data from your\n\nCRM\n\n, integrating with third-party apps, or hooking into IoT devices, low-code makes it seamless.\n\nContinuous innovation, zero downtime\n\nInnovation never sleeps, and with low-code, neither does your business. Continuous deployment and\n\nDevOps\n\npractices enable you to roll out updates and new features with zero downtime. It’s like upgrading your car while you’re driving – smooth, seamless, and always moving forward.\n\nHow to use low-code in your business\n\nThese are the main steps to have your low-code game on point in no time.\n\n1. Assess your needs\n\nWhile low-code is very easy to get started with, it does requires teams to figure out what they need first. Identify the pain points and areas where low-code could make a real difference. Make a list of requirements the app should feature, as well as the data structure. Even though you can change it further down the road, it is worth giving it some thought beforehand to make deployment easier. List potential users and their use cases. And obviously, don’t forget to write down your business model for the app or how do you expect for it to pay back your investment.\n\n2. Research platforms\n\nResearch and evaluate different low-code platforms. Compare features, such as ease of use, scalability, integration capabilities, security features, and pricing. Read reviews and find one that fits your needs – that you defined in the previous step. For example, check out\n\nOutSystems\n\n, a comprehensive suite of tools for rapid application development.\n\n2. Build the database\n\nMost apps start with data, and low-code apps are no different. Before working on the app’s design, prepare your tables and build the relations between data (you know, one book can have multiple authors, one author can write multiple books and so on). Make sure your database covers your use cases and user needs, at the least the ones you can think of for now, before proceeding.\n\n3. Start small\n\nTake a pragmatic approach and start with manageable projects to familiarize yourself and your team with the low-code platform. Once you’ve got the hang of things, you can ramp up the complexity.\n\n5. Develop and test\n\nUse the low-code platform to develop applications or automate processes based on the identified use cases. Test them thoroughly to iron out any kinks before rolling them out. Remember to test for different users before rolling out.\n\n6. Integrate and deploy\n\nIntegrate your new apps with existing systems and databases as needed. Then, deploy them into the wild and let them work their magic.\n\n7. Train your team\n\nGet everyone up to speed with some solid training sessions. Make sure they’re comfortable with the platform and ready to hit the ground running.\n\n8. Monitor and maintain\n\nKeep an eye on things to ensure everything’s running smoothly. Address any issues that pop up and keep your apps in top shape.\n\n9. Stay on top of things\n\nKeep looking for ways to optimize and improve your applications over time. Gather feedback from users and stakeholders. Iterate on the existing applications or develop new ones using the low-code platform to further streamline processes and drive innovation.\n\nDownload eBook “Demystifying Low-Code\n\n3 Case Studies: accelerating business transformation with low-code\n\nLet’s look at real world examples of how low-code is making development a lot easier.\n\n1.Transforming paper-based workflows into efficient digital solutions\n\nWe worked with a leading IT Consulting Company to help their business clients get actionable information from physical documents using Outsystems. The fast-paced technological evolution around the world has increased the need for digitalization. But paper is still a reality in many companies, be it for legally binding documents, insurance details, complaints or invoices. Near Partner worked with a leading IT consulting house that processes and scans physical documents for business clients. With facilities around the world, this customer required a robust solution that could store, organize and present millions of documents efficiently.\n\nResponding to such a large-scale challenge required a cross-functional team comprising members of both the Customer and Near Partner.\n\nOur first goal was overcoming the unstructured nature of the scanned documents. Each had its own format, fields, heading and content, which had to be categorized and processed before the “real”automation work could begin. We also developed a new workflow that enabled the consultant’s customers to get the best of their database.\n\n2. Revamping CRM and Complex Operations Processes with Salesforce\n\nQMC\n\ndesigns wireless infrastructures that incorporate innovative technologies such as 5G, smart cities, IoT, virtual reality and artificial intelligence. They work with an array of customers, such as municipalities, shopping malls, hotels, hospitals, office buildings, and airports, to provide users with faster and more reliable communication capabilities. But this global presence comes with some unique challenges in managing complex sales processes and project implementation.\n\nWe deployed\n\nSalesforce\n\nand\n\nSitetracker\n\n, two technologies that allowed the sales process to be managed with ease but required customization for QMC’s specific needs. With these two technologies in place, QMC could improve the sales process, which includes customer insights, business opportunities and established contracts. This automated way of working has replaced what was once a manual process. Data is no longer stored without structure, and a centralized database allows for better organization and automation. By developing a new workflow and application to support project implementation, our team improved tasks control, reporting and maintenance status. With this solution, onboarding of new employees vital to QMC’s growth follows a standardized path.\n\nPartnering up: OutSystems x Near Partner\n\nAt Near Partner, we are big advocates of\n\nOutSystems\n\n, the leading low-code platform for the development of mobile and web applications.\n\nWhy OutSystems, you ask?\n\nOutSystems means development costs are much lower, and Time to Market is up to 4x faster.\n\nThe OutSystems platform is intuitive and user friendly, and allows business users to build highly responsive applications, easily integrated with existing systems.\n\nIt allows for custom features to be added to your project or evolve applications at the pace that your business needs them.\n\nAt Near Partner you get personalised support with all the steps of development and maintenance.\n\nOutSystems provides a platform with advanced enterprise features to enable seamless growth.\n\nYou’d be right to guess that we are OutSystems fans.

    "content": "Low-code development accelerates time-to-market while saving money. This is what it is and what it means to companies.\n\nWhat if you could create the software you company needs to grow, tailored to your specific needs, rather than relying on third party, one-size-fits-all programs? And what if it could be ready in a matter of weeks without breaking the bank? Low-code has been making waves and reshaping the way applications are built for years now. It speeds what used to be long, complex, and expensive development processes, and makes creating applications much more exciting and democratic since many more people can partake. But what does this mean for companies?\n\nWhat is low-code development?\n\nLow-code development represents a paradigm shift in software engineering. It provides a framework where developers and citizen developers (everyone without a computer science degree or coding background) can create apps through visual interfaces and drag-and-drop functionality,\n\nrather than manual coding\n\n. At its core, it democratizes sophisticated software development, making it accessible to those without a technical background.\n\nSource:\n\nmordor\n\nWith low-code, intuitive tools and pre-built components come together to break down barriers of traditional and extensive coding expertise, empowering business users and IT professionals alike to contribute to create custom solutions tailored to their specific needs.\n\nHow low-code platforms work\n\nLow-code platforms typically feature a visual development environment where users can build user interfaces, define logic, and integrate with external systems using a graphical interface rather than writing lines of code manually. These platforms leverage a combination of visual modelling, declarative programming, and code generation techniques to streamline the development process.\n\nOne of the key components of these platforms is the visual drag-and-drop interface, which allows users to assemble\n\napplication components like building blocks\n\n. Users can select from a library of pre-built templates, widgets, and connectors to rapidly prototype and iterate on their applications. Additionally, low-code platforms often incorporate features such as workflow automation, data integration and application lifecycle management to further enhance productivity and collaboration.\n\nFor instance, in the financial services sector,\n\nlow-code platforms\n\nenable banks and fintech companies to develop and deploy innovative mobile apps, loan systems, and regulatory compliance solutions quickly.\n\nSimilarly, in the healthcare industry, it facilitates the creation of electronic health record (EHR) systems, patient engagement portals, and telemedicine applications, empowering healthcare providers to deliver better patient care and streamline administrative workflows.\n\nAdvantages\n\nThe adoption of low-code development brings numerous benefits to organizations of all sizes, including:\n\nAccelerated time-to-market\n\nA significant\n\n72% of IT leaders\n\nreport that their strategic projects are hindered by a backlog of tickets, with a considerable amount of their resources devoted to the upkeep of\n\nlegacy systems\n\n.\n\nBy reducing the time and effort required for application development, low-code platforms enable organizations to\n\nbring new products and services to market faster\n\n, gaining a competitive edge in today’s fast-paced business environment.\n\nCost-efficiency\n\nBy minimizing the need for custom coding and simplifying maintenance tasks, low-code platforms help organizations reduce development costs and total cost of ownership (TCO) over the application lifecycle.\n\nEmpowered citizen developers\n\nLow-code platforms enable non-technical users to participate in application creation. This democratization fosters innovation and collaboration across departments, driving\n\ndigital transformation\n\ninitiatives forward.\n\nChallenges and limitations\n\nWhile it offers a multitude of benefits, it is not without its challenges and limitations. These are some potential drawbacks.\n\nScalability concerns\n\nWhile low-code platforms excel at rapid application development, they may struggle to accommodate growing user bases, complex business processes, or increased data volumes – especially if best practices of building low-code apps are not being considered from the start. Organizations must carefully evaluate the scalability capabilities of their chosen low-code platform and ensure it can support their long-term growth objectives.\n\nVendor lock-in\n\nAdopting a specific low-code platform can potentially lead to vendor lock-in, where organizations become reliant on a single vendor’s tools, technologies, and services. This dependence can limit flexibility and autonomy, making it challenging to transition to alternative solutions or migrate applications to different platforms in the future. To mitigate the risk of vendor lock-in, organizations should assess the interoperability and portability features of low-code platforms and consider strategies for vendor diversification.\n\nComplexity of customization\n\nWhile low-code platforms offer a range of pre-built components and templates to accelerate development, customizing applications to meet specific business requirements can sometimes be complex. Balancing the speed of development with the need for customization requires careful planning and expertise.\n\nSecurity and compliance risks\n\nSecurity and compliance are paramount concerns in software development, and low-code applications are no exception. While low-code platforms typically incorporate security features such as role-based access control and data encryption, organizations must ensure that their applications adhere to industry standards and regulatory requirements. Additionally, the use of third-party integrations and external data sources introduces potential\n\nsecurity vulnerabilities\n\nthat need to be addressed through robust testing and security protocols.\n\nUse cases and applications\n\nLow-code development has gained traction across\n\nvarious industries and use cases\n\n, empowering organizations to innovate faster, streamline processes, and deliver value to customers more efficiently.\n\nEnterprise applications\n\nLow-code is widely used to develop mission-critical enterprise applications, such as customer relationship management (CRM) systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions, and supply chain management (SCM) applications. These applications help organizations automate business processes, improve operational efficiency, and enhance collaboration across departments.\n\nBusiness process automation\n\nAbout one in every four executives\n\nconsider low-code platforms as the most critical investment in automation. Why? Because low-code facilitates the\n\nautomation of repetitive tasks and workflows\n\n, streamlines business processes and reduces manual effort. From approval workflows and document management to invoice processing and employee onboarding, low-code platforms empower businesses to automate a wide range of processes to drive efficiency and productivity.\n\nDigital transformation initiatives\n\nLow-code plays a pivotal role in digital transformation initiatives, enabling organizations to modernize legacy systems, connect distributed teams, digitize paper-based processes, and innovate at scale. By leveraging these platforms, businesses can accelerate their digital transformation journey, embrace emerging technologies, and stay competitive in today’s digital economy.\n\nMobile app development\n\nLow-code offers robust capabilities for mobile app development, allowing organizations to create cross-platform mobile applications for iOS, Android, and other mobile platforms. Whether building customer-facing mobile apps, employee productivity tools, or field service applications, low-code development streamlines mobile app development.\n\nInternet of Things (IoT) solutions\n\nCompanies are glowingly using low-code to develop IoT solutions that connect devices, sensors, and systems to collect, analyse, and act on data in real-time. This can include monitoring equipment performance, optimizing energy usage, or managing smart home devices. Low-code simplifies IoT application development and accelerates time-to-value in this rapidly evolving landscape.\n\nEducational technology (EdTech)\n\nIn the education sector, low-code facilitates the development of e-learning platforms, student information systems, and administrative tools to support teaching, learning, and administrative functions. By leveraging low-code development, educational institutions can enhance student engagement, personalize learning experiences, and improve administrative efficiency.\n\nHealthcare solutions\n\nHealthcare industry is being transformed by the creation of electronic health record (EHR) systems, telemedicine platforms, and patient engagement applications.

    "content": "A few years ago, the software development world was rocked by a new, revolutionary approach to coding: not doing it at all.\n\nDriven by the need to\n\nkeep up with fast changing tech\n\nand the ever present goal of saving time and money, many companies were lured by the speed, ease, and off-the-shelf approach of\n\nlow-code platforms\n\nsuch as OutSystems and countless others. Suddenly, managers were asking questions like “is my business a software business?” (even if they worked in, say, agriculture) or “can anyone in my organization really develop applications?” (even if they employed zero programmers)? It seemed promising – until it all changed, once again, with AI.\n\nThe combination of AI with low-code platforms opens up a world of possibilities, democratizing access to the creation of innovative applications and solutions. Hey, why not ask chat-GPT to build you a CRM? That customer portal you’ve been working on for years? Just use any number of low-code templates and customize them with AI. No wonder\n\nNvidia’s CEO recent proclaimed that “coding is dead”.\n\nCould it really be that easy?\n\nEven though AI and low-code are a recent mix, they are already widely used, so it is possible to discern a few really great ways to use them – and a lot of potential risks to avoid.\n\nWhat is low-code and how does it work?\n\nLow-code\n\nis a software development concept that goes something like this: what if you could create applications, websites, and other platforms using little to\n\nno code\n\n. It was created in 2014 as a response to the demand for simpler and more accessible software development solutions.\n\nLow-code platforms are highly visual and intuitive, employing a drag-and-drop model that removes the need to write complex code. They come with a set of pre-configured components, making it easy to build information flows, present data attractively, or automate actions. You can use them to build a number of applications: for instance, build\n\nworkflow automation\n\nin a matter of days or weeks, instead of months, ensuring seamless integration across all systems in a personalized manner. Or you could build your own project management tool, customized to your needs (say\n\nadieu\n\nto old Trello boards or Asana lists). Building the CRM or ERP of your dreams is also possible. And the list goes on and on.\n\nTo do so, you’ll need a low-code platform. That’s the platform you’ll use to actually build the applications and picking the right one is essential. Each has its own pros and cons and is geared towards specific use cases.\n\nOutSystems\n\n, for instance, is one of the leading low-code platforms driving this digital transformation. Using this platform, we’ve built, deployed and managed countless\n\nenterprise\n\nmobile and web applications incredibly quickly.\n\nTake\n\nFINHAUS\n\n, a real estate lending digital transformation company. We helped them streamline their data recovery and approval process, reducing their initial timeframe from six months to a maximum of two weeks. We also supported\n\nKinda Home\n\nin modernizing their management and logistics systems. That included developing a mobile frontend for stock control in stores and integrating with multiple logistics transportation companies. Human resources departments can also benefit from a low-code approach. For example,\n\nNOS\n\ncontacted us to develop a human resources application able to manage and create users, permissions, and roles, as well as automatically send emails and SMS to users with alerts and relevant information. We also automated the creation of mailboxes, as well as the management and creation of shared folders.\n\nDownload eBook “Demystifying Low-Code\n\nWhen AI met low-code\n\nAround\n\n77% of companies are either using or exploring the use of AI\n\nin their businesses.\n\nBut AI could play an even larger role when combined with low-code – like suggest alternative software designs or help you write complex business logic rules and processes. Here are a few of the most promising applications.\n\nAI can help developers streamline the entire low-code application lifecycle\n\nOne of the most significant trends shaping the future of AI and low-code is the increasing integration of AI-driven automation throughout the entire application development lifecycle. From initial design and prototyping to deployment and maintenance, AI-enabled low-code platforms will empower developers to automate mundane tasks, accelerate development cycles, and focus on solving higher-order problems.\n\nAI can help low-code application users automate routine tasks\n\nAI in low-code allows you to automate various processes, from document management to data analysis and report generation. For example, a human resources department can create and implement an automated recruitment system that analyzes CVs, conducts virtual interviews, and recommends candidates based on predefined criteria. This speeds up hiring, reduces human bias, and increases operational efficiency.\n\nFor sales and marketing teams, AI in low-code can automate email campaigns, generate personalized commercial proposals, and free up time for analysts and salespeople to nurture relationships with leads and customers. We recently developed a mobile application for\n\nCertis Group\n\nto manage employee absences and expenses.\n\nAI enables users to interact with low-code apps in entirely new ways\n\nWhat if you could query your own company database for the latest marketing or sales figures? What if your clients had the ability to “ask” the app (instead of you) for the launch date of the next email campaign? AI can breathe new ways for users to interact with apps, replacing the need to search, process and analyze raw data and tables. These tools facilitate the exchange of information between companies, employees, and customers, serving an efficient communication channel that operates 24/7.\n\nUsers can get more from the data in their low-code apps\n\nData analysis is also essential for decision-making in any company. Low-code platforms with integrated AI make it easier to analyze large volumes of data in real time. For instance, low-code systems using natural language processing algorithms can analyze large volumes of structured or unstructured data to identify trends, common issues, and opportunities for service improvement. It can also generate reports and alerts without previously defined rules  – a major difference versus traditional development.\n\nAI enhances low-code app design\n\nIncorporating AI into low-code platforms can revolutionize software development by suggesting alternative design approaches and optimizing user interfaces. For instance, AI algorithms can analyze user behavior data to suggest optimal layouts for web pages or mobile applications. By considering factors such as user engagement metrics and usability principles, AI can recommend changes to improve the layout’s effectiveness in guiding users towards desired actions.\n\nAI-powered low-code platforms can dynamically adapt user interfaces based on individual preferences, behavior patterns, or demographics. For instance, an e-commerce website can personalize product recommendations, navigation menus, and content layout to enhance each user’s shopping experience. AI can assist designers in creating visually appealing interfaces by suggesting color schemes, typography choices, and graphic elements.\n\nAI can streamline writing advanced logic\n\nAI-powered low-code platforms can also assist in writing complex business logic rules and optimizing workflow processes. For instance, AI algorithms can analyze large datasets and historical patterns to automate decision-making processes within the application. For instance, in a financial application, AI can predict credit risk scores or recommend investment strategies based on market trends and user preferences.\n\nLow-code platforms with AI capabilities can automate repetitive tasks and enforce business rules without manual intervention. For example, in an inventory management system, AI can trigger reorder alerts based on predefined inventory thresholds and supplier lead times. Low-code platforms integrated with NLP capabilities can interpret and process human language inputs, enabling chatbots or virtual assistants to understand user queries and perform actions accordingly. For example, in a customer service application, AI-powered chatbots can respond to customer inquiries, escalate issues to human agents when necessary, and update relevant records in real-time.\n\nAI can even optimize workflow processes by analyzing task dependencies, resource availability, and performance metrics. For instance, in a project management application, AI can dynamically allocate resources, adjust task priorities, and identify potential bottlenecks to ensure timely project delivery and resource efficiency.\n\nCons of using AI in low code\n\nOrganizational culture and the complexity of the technological infrastructure can pose significant obstacles. These are some of AI in low-code limitations.\n\nCosts\n\nFor many companies, the costs associated with implementing new digital technologies can be prohibitive. Additionally, calculating and guaranteeing a tangible and measurable return on investment can be complex, making it difficult to justify these expenses.\n\nLearning curve\n\nDespite the simplicity of low-code platforms, a certain level of familiarity with AI concepts and software development is still required to use the technology effectively.\n\nTransparency and understanding\n\nIt is important to be clear about how AI algorithms are making decisions, what data is being used, and in what way. A lack of transparency can lead to trust issues and make it difficult to identify errors or biases in AI models. When using AI in low-code, it is extremely important to guarantee the security and privacy of the data used during the development and operation of each project.\n\nMaintenance and updating\n\nAI models need regular maintenance and updating to ensure that they continue to function accurately and efficiently. This requires specific resources and expertise.\n\nThe Future Convergence of AI and Low-Code Platforms\n\nAs we look ahead, it’s becoming increasingly evident that the future of software development lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and low-code platforms. These two transformative technologies are poised to merge seamlessly, blurring the lines between them and fundamentally reshaping the way applications are built and deployed.\n\nWith AI embedded directly into the low-code environment, developers can leverage advanced machine learning algorithms to automate repetitive tasks, optimize design decisions, and enhance the functionality of their applications. As AI algorithms continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, we can expect low-code platforms to incorporate increasingly advanced AI capabilities, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and predictive analytics. This convergence will enable developers to build applications that are not only intelligent but also capable of understanding and adapting to user behavior in real-time.\n\nUltimately, the convergence of AI and low-code platforms holds immense potential to democratize software development, making it more accessible and empowering a new generation of developers. As this convergence continues to unfold, we can expect to see a wave of AI-powered applications that are smarter, faster, and more capable than ever before.\n\nNear Partner, experts at low-code and AI\n\nLooking for the right low-code / AI partner?

Learn how to\n\ncommunicate effectively\n\nfor better project management.\n\nWhy do some teams seem to be always in sync while others\n\nfight\n\nbitterly over the smallest details? And which of them communicates better? While there may not be consensus on what “effective” communication actually means, the\n\nre are\n\nsurely no questions about its importance: teams who communicate effectively may\n\nincrease their productivity by as much as 25%.\n\nUnsurprisingly, communication also improves engagement, retention, and trust.\n\nThese are the key benefits of two-sided, feedback-rich communication, and how to apply it to project management.\n\nCheck the 8 IT project management skills you need to succeed.\n\nThe benefits of effective communication\n\nImproved productivity\n\nAn organisation where information is\n\ncommunicated clearly, where everyone is\n\nin sync and knows what their roles are, what is expected of them, and how to do it, is a more productive place.\n\nImproved productivity in an organization hinges on clear communication, role clarity, and mutual understanding of expectations.\n\nA prime example is the daily Scrum meeting, a key practice in Agile methodologies. During these brief, time-boxed meetings, team members share what they accomplished yesterday, what they plan to do today, and any obstacles in their way. This practice ensures that everyone is aligned, aware of their roles, and able to address issues promptly. Effective communication, like passing client requirements accurately to the team, is vital for maintaining productivity and delivering successful outcomes.\n\nCheck how to be productive in online meetings\n\nMitigated conflicts\n\nMost conflicts happen because of ineffective communication or misunderstandings. While some conflicts can be easily solved, without any external action, sometimes a good mediator can untie the knot by stepping into the conflict and helping communication between both sides.\n\nHealthier workplace culture and increased retention\n\nIt’s no secret that open communication and giving feedback between coworkers, teams, higher ups, and different departments fosters a healthier environment. Having a clear and strong company culture is vital for job satisfaction and employee retention, while employee talent recognised and acknowledged increases engagement at the workplace, which feeds into productivity.\n\nLuis Silva, our internal coach at Near Partner, has significantly contributed to our team’s success. His approach to coaching involves fostering open communication and building trust, which has made feedback sessions both productive and positive. Through his mentorship, we’ve developed a robust framework for personal and professional growth, making continuous improvement a core aspect of our work culture. Luis’s support has been a key driver in our journey towards excellence.\n\nLearn about\n\nNear Partner’s company culture and what drives us\n\n, leading to\n\nemployees who are happy\n\nwith their jobs and roles, and satisfied with the organisation they work in.\n\nKnowing project status\n\nA Project Manager needs to communicate closely and frequently with its team to track project status, identify any blockers or delays, reorganize the work, help the team and communicate the project status to the customer.\n\nCustomer relationship and satisfaction\n\nHaving transparent and honest communication with your customers is crucial to maintain their satisfaction and a healthy relationship along the project duration, and even after.\n\nHow to\n\ncommunicate effectively\n\nReady to\n\nimprove\n\nyour communication\n\ngame? Try ou\n\nt these tested\n\ntips on your projects.\n\nBe clear\n\nNumber one mistake in communication is to expect your audience to “read between the lines”. People aren’t mind readers, psychics, or experts in behavioural analysis. For example, it is much more productive to set or negotiate a deadline, than to leave it open with expressions such as “ASAP”, “soon”, or similar.\n\nConfirm everyone is on the same page\n\nAsk questions or rephrase, with your own words, what your interlocutor just said to be sure you both understood the same thing. It will earn you\n\ntime in the future, avoiding misunderstandings or even rework.\n\nPlan moments of reflexion and discussion\n\nSchedule meetings like retrospective, brainstorming, lessons learned to invite your team to reflect and discuss on important topics, on what can be improved, should be kept or removed. This is a good way to gather feedback from your team and to give them a safe space to express themselves. Topics and issues can vary from process, project, technical stuff or even to relationships. Make sure everyone has the same time to express his opinion.\n\nGet involved\n\nEffective communication is the cornerstone of a productive and harmonious workplace. To communicate effectively, it’s crucial to leverage a blend of verbal, non-verbal, visual, and written communication. Each form serves a unique purpose and can be used to enhance clarity, build relationships, and ensure that messages are received and understood accurately.\n\nSome important key notes you can have in mind: when in meetings make sure you practice active listening and adjust your tone and pace to exciting news or serious discussions; regarding non-verbal communication, you can maintain appropriate eye contact to show confidence and engagement; when it comes to written communication always proofread for grammar, spelling, and clarity before sending.\n\nDon’t be afraid of heated debates\n\nIntense debates can yield positive results, as long as discussions are kept to the subject at hand. The trick is to know when to stop – do it too soon and you might be stifling innovation, do it too late and risk getting lost in the heat of the moment.\n\nListen just as much as you speak\n\nCommunication should flow both ways. If you are trying to explain how a project should be executed, it is natural that those involved will have something to add to the conversation. Additionally, active listening will make your teams feel heard and involved in the project at hand.\n\nAdapt the message to your audi\n\nence\n\nAs a Project Manager your audiences can vary tremendously. Speaking to customers, reporting to your manager or explaining project goals to your development team requires adapting your communication style and language.\n\nNever forget positive feedback\n\nWhile all feedback is valuable, positive feedback can go a long way in motivating a tea\n\nm. So, even if the news isn’t exactly good, try to find some bits of positive feedback. For example, if you need to have a difficult meeting about missed deadlines, try to include a positive comment on everyone’s effort.\n\nDon’t be afraid of individual meetings\n\nSometimes having a one-on-one is all you need\n\nto help a team member get more confident and into the spirit of the team. Use this moment to give specific and constructive feedback, to reinforce your relationship and to check his satisfaction.\n\nUse the right tools\n\nLuckily nowadays we have a range of technological tools to help us communicate in the best way possible. From video conferencing to internal chats, discussion forums, AI assisted writing tools, Slack, Discord, Trello, the right channels can help keep everyone\n\ninforme\n\nd. Prefer synchronous conversation such as video calls to asynchronous like text messages to convey more information, also using body language or voice tone, to your receptor.\n\nA picture is worth a thousand words\n\nReinforce your communication and support your ideas with drawings, sketches, wireframes or examples. Attach a Figma file to your development story to be sure everyone is on the same page, or a screenshot with an example of bug showing what should be the correct way and detail the steps to reproduce it.\n\nDon’t be condescending\n\nThere are people who like things explained as if “they were five years old”, but there are also people who absolutely don’t. As a rule of thumb, try to be clear and explicit, but don’t fall on the trap of sounding like a preschool teacher.\n\nInvite questions\n\nInvite each and every member of your audience to ask questions related to the topic or project at hand. It can not only help them, but also you, the speaker, understand important difficulties or obstacles in the project.\n\nA partner with whom you can\n\ncommunicate effectively\n\nat every stage\n\nAt Near Partner, we strive to help our clients achieve their goals by delivering customised, quality IT solutions – from custom apps to legacy system modernisation.

Here’s what it actually means and how to do it right.\n\nWhat is Salesforce customization?\n\nSalesforce\n\ncustomization options essentially allow you to adapt the world’s leading CRM to your unique business needs. Instead of sticking with the default setup (which is a good start), you go beyond to make it work just the way you want. This could mean tweaking fields, workflows, or creating entirely new features using Salesforce’s customization tools like Apex (for coding wizards) or the more user-friendly point-and-click interface.\n\nIn a nutshell, it’s all about making it fit perfectly for your business, ensuring every button, pocket, and stitch is exactly where you need it to be.\n\nSalesforce customization pros\n\nSalesforce customization offers a range of benefits for businesses looking to tailor their tech solutions to their specific needs.\n\nBespoke to you\n\nCustomization allows you to adapt Salesforce to perfectly fit your unique business processes and requirements. Instead of bending your processes to fit the platform, you can tailor the CRM to work for you. Just remember to streamline and optimize your processes before making changes to the CRM to avoid automating inefficiencies.\n\nIncreased efficiency\n\nBy streamlining workflows, automating repetitive tasks, and adding custom features, you can boost productivity within your team.\n\nEnhanced user adoption\n\nWhen Salesforce feels like it’s speaking your language, your team will be all over it. It becomes more intuitive and user-friendly, as your team members find it easier and more enjoyable to use.\n\nData done right\n\nCustomization allows you to capture and organize data in a way that makes sense for your business. You can create custom fields, objects, and relationships to ensure that you’re collecting the right information and that it’s structured in a way that’s useful for analysis and reporting.\n\nCompetitive advantage\n\nBy leveraging Salesforce customization to create unique features or processes that give you a competitive edge in your industry, you can differentiate yourself from competitors and drive business growth.\n\nSalesforce customization cons\n\nOn the other hand, it’s essential to weigh these benefits against the potential drawbacks to ensure that customization fits like a glove.\n\nComplexity\n\nCustomizing Salesforce can be complex, especially for more advanced customization requiring coding skills. It requires a deep understanding of Salesforce’s architecture and can be time-consuming to implement. Sometimes, it is better to have the right partner by your side to guide you customization process. At Near Partner, we have years of experience designing and implementing custom Salesforce solutions.\n\nMaintenance overhead\n\nCustomizations require ongoing maintenance and updates to ensure compatibility with new\n\nSalesforce releases\n\nor changes to your business processes. Failure to keep customizations up-to-date can lead to issues down the line.\n\nRisk of over-engineering\n\nIt’s easy to get carried away with customization, adding unnecessary complexity or features that aren’t actually beneficial to your business. This can lead to a cluttered and confusing Salesforce instance that hinders rather than helps productivity.\n\nVendor lock-in\n\nExtensive customization can make it challenging to switch to a different platform in the future, as migrating customizations and data can be a complex and expensive process. This can potentially limit your flexibility and ability to adapt to changing business needs.\n\nSalesforce customization: how to do it right\n\nKickstart your Salesforce journey with these must-know steps.\n\nAssess your needs\n\nFirst things first, take a step back and figure out what you actually need. Are there specific processes that could be smoother? Data you wish you were tracking? Get clear on your goals before diving in.\n\nHere are a few potential business goals\n\ncustomization can help achieve:\n\nImprove Sales Efficiency\n\n: Streamline lead management and qualification, automate follow-up tasks and reminders and track sales performance with custom reports\n\nEnhance Customer Service\n\n: Salesforce can help you implement a custom ticketing system, track customer interactions and service history and automate case routing and escalation\n\nOptimize Marketing Efforts\n\n: Customization can help you better segment and target specific customer groups, track campaign performance and ROI, and integrate with marketing automation tools\n\nBetter Data Management\n\n: It can also ensure accurate and complete data entry, create custom objects for unique data points and implement data validation and cleansing rules\n\nImprove Forecasting and Planning\n\n: By customizing, you can better develop customized forecasting models, generate real-time sales forecasts and analyze trends with advanced reporting\n\nIncrease Collaboration\n\n: A key benefit of customization is the possibility to set up custom communication channels, share insights and updates with teams and collaborate on projects and tasks\n\nEnhance User Experience\n\n: You can personalize dashboards and interfaces, simplify navigation with custom menus and implement mobile-friendly layouts\n\nEnsure Compliance and Security\n\n: With Salesforce customization, you can create custom profiles and access controls, implement field-level security and encryption, and maintain audit trails for regulatory compliance\n\nIntegrate with Other Systems\n\n: You can sync data with ERP and other business systems, connect with third-party applications and automate data transfers between platforms\n\nAutomate Routine Tasks\n\n: Salesforce customization allows you to set up workflows for repetitive tasks, trigger automatic updates and notifications and schedule regular data backups and maintenance\n\nEnhance Customer Insights\n\n: Salesforce customization enables you to track customer behavior and preferences, analyze customer feedback and satisfaction and develop personalized marketing and sales strategies\n\nSelecting which potential benefits you’re aiming for can help you prioritize efforts.\n\nStart small\n\nStart with small tweaks and adjustments. Before diving headfirst into complex customizations, explore what Salesforce already offers out of the box. You might be surprised at how much you can achieve with just a few clicks. Salesforce offers plenty of point-and-click customization tools that don’t require any coding.\n\nPlay around with things like Layout Editor, Process Builder, and Flow Builder to see what you can build. Familiarize yourself with Salesforce’s customization tools and terminology. Get cozy with things like fields, objects, workflows, and validation rules – they’ll be your bread and butter.\n\nTest, test, test\n\nBefore unleashing your customizations on your entire team, make sure to thoroughly test them out in a sandbox environment. You don’t want any surprises when it comes to crunch time. As you test customization features, keep detailed documentation of what you’ve done and why. Future you (and anyone else who comes along) will thank you for it.\n\nDon’t be afraid to ask for help\n\nIf you’re feeling stuck or overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to reach out for help and bring in some reinforcements. Hiring a consultant partner can help you navigate the complexities of Salesforce with ease, saving you time and headaches in the long run, while freeing you up to focus on what you do best – running your business.\n\nNear Partner, your partner for Salesforce customization\n\nWith a team of seasoned and certified experts at the helm, Near Partner is dedicated to helping businesses like yours unlock the full potential of\n\nSalesforce\n\n.

    "content": "Sure, AI is changing everything in tech. But that is far from the only\n\nthreat/opportunity in our space – it is not even the latest.\n\nThese are 8 tech trends you just\n\ncan’t\n\nmiss.\n\nWhen you look back at 2023, it is easy to feel gobsmacked by seismic changes such as Generative AI. However, the years ahead show no signs of slowing down, as new trends powerful enough to change every aspect of tech life emerge.\n\nFrom mind-boggling 5G speeds to successive AI advancements, we’re talking full disruption across the board – be it agriculture, healthcare, banking, or leisure time. These 7 tech trends can (and probably will) reshape industries, the way we work and connect, and everything in between.\n\n1 – Generative AI, building something from nothing\n\nLet’s start with the trend on everyone’s lips.\n\nGenerative AI refers to algorithms that can be used to create content such as audio, video, text, images, simulations and even code.\n\nThat being said, Generative AI relies on data from various sources to learn from, and then adds its own spin to generate something new. ChatGPT is a great example, where anyone can create anything from an attractive CVs debug code, get step-by-step solutions for math problems, write music or poetry, among others.\n\nDon’t linger in Chat GPT’s shadow. Emerging cost-free alternatives offer even greater precision and access to the latest data. Have you heard of\n\nCaude.ai\n\n? This incredible tool is currently only available in the United States and the United Kingdom, but they are just a few steps away from deploying worldwide. Check them out!\n\nGenerative AI have an impact on most business functions, but a few stand out when measured by the technology’s impact as a share of functional cost.\n\nSource:\n\nMckinsey\n\nThis technology has a vast potential across a range of applications. It can be used to enhance medical diagnostics, provide real-time guidance to surgeons, help scientists with research, detect bank fraud… the possibilities are (almost) endless.\n\n2. The Metaverse, the literal digital world\n\nPicture a digital universe where, instead of scrolling through screens, you “exist” in an immersive experience, with 3D realistic visuals and audio, and even tactile sensations. That’s the metaverse – a blend of augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), wearables, AI, 5G, and social technologies.\n\nImagine going to concerts as your digital avatar, visiting the Louvre like you are actually there, or even work at a virtual office and have a coffee break with your colleagues… while sitting at home.\n\nWith 400 million monthly users\n\n, the Metaverse was valued at $58 billion in 2021, and is expected to reach $1.5 trillion (yes, trillion) by 2030.\n\n3. Edge Computing and 5G, as virtuous as cycles get\n\nAlright, picture this: a future where the norm is super-fast internet that’s practically everywhere. Now, add reliable self-driving cars, smart cities, instant streaming, or even remote surgery into the mix. This is the potential of the power couple edge computing and 5G. It’s like\n\n5G is turbocharging the internet\n\n, and edge computing is supercharging the network. The result is ultra-fast connections, real-time data transfer, highly responsive devices, decentralized networks, and overall immersive, dynamic, and transformative experiences.\n\nThis dynamic duo is one of the main tech trends because its applications touch almost every single industry, such as manufacturing, energy, and utilities. Think smart grids and efficient energy distribution, precise farming, disaster prediction… and the list goes on.\n\n4. Quantum Computing, turbocharging computer power\n\nIf regular computing power is a bicycle, then a quantum computer is a spaceship. Crazy, huh? Well, not to everyone: IBM, Google, Microsoft and Intel\n\nall have or are developing their own quantum computers\n\n. Quantum computing will be a game-changer, especially in the areas of climate change, materials and drug research, finance, and cybersecurity. See, quantum computers have the capacity to run extremely complex simulations – quantum simulations – that not even supercomputers can handle.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that while the potential impact of quantum computing is vast and impressive, it is still an emerging field; practical and scalable quantum computers are still in the early stages of development and there are quite some challenges to address. Still, it probably won’t be long until it is a viable technology – and a major tech trend for the years ahead. Learn more about Generative AI, Edge Computing and Quantum Computing with this AI Buzzword decoder.\n\n5. Sustainable Tech, the tech trend the world actually needs\n\nSustainable tech is already\n\na thing\n\n; however, it will probably grow f\n\nast\n\n. First, we need it. Solar panels, wind turbines, and energy-efficient buildings are already reducing carbon footprints and fostering cleaner energy ecosystems. Electric vehicles are steering us away from fossil fuels, while smart grids optimize energy distribution. Secondly, other new emergent technologies such as AI, 5G, edge and quantum computing can expand the reach of sustainable technology. They can add smart, fast decision-making capabilities, ultra-fast and low latency networks, and astronomical computing power.\n\nThe future of sustainable technology lies in carbon dioxide capture, innovative biodegradable materials, water purification technologies, and highly accurate environmental forecasting methods. It also includes\n\nnext-level farm tech\n\n. Sustainable tech is not only one of the tech trends but also a hope for a healthier, greener tomorrow.\n\n6. Biotech & Bioengineering, reengineering ourselves\n\nUnfortunately, we can’t (yet) preserve someone in a cryogenically frozen state and wake them up in a few centuries, but there are a lot of amazing things we can do. Creating lab-grown organs for transplant or cruelty-free meat are good examples. Scientists can identify and isolate specific genes (out of literally thousands) accountable for various conditions, genetically modify plants to make them more resistant to low temperatures, or even create bionic limbs! All these are a result of incredible biotechnology and bioengineering advancements over the years.\n\nCombined with other innovative technologies, biotechnology and bioengineering can go to a whole other level. Computer-mind communication, human enhancement, synthetic ecosystems, environmental restoration can well be within our grasp.\n\nFor now, biotechnology and bioengineering are included in the tech trends 2024 because they have very real applications that can solve daily problems, such as AI diagnostics, AI-driven genome research, 5G-enabled remote healthcare monitoring and telemedicine, 5G-connected wearable biomedical devices, AI-guided biomaterials research, or AI-enhanced crop genomics.\n\n7. (Zero Trust) Cybersecurity, the tech trend that assumes everyone is out to get you\n\nZero Trust security is a cybersecurity approach that assumes no inherent trust within a network, operating under the assumption of constant threat. This means every user and device need to be cleared, regardless of their location or network. This approach replaces the outdated previous model of “trust but verify,” with an uncompromising “never trust, always verify” model. Zero Trust Cybersecurity relies on processes like continuous monitoring, continuous authentication, micro-segmentation, multi-factor authentication, and least privilege access to mitigate the risks associated with perimeter-based cybersecurity where users and devices inside a secure network are trusted.\n\nBy ensuring security at every point of interaction, Zero Trust minimizes breaches, strengthening data protection and data integrity. Zero Trust security is one of the main tech trends, since cloud technologies, decentralised technologies, and networks, and even edge computing are shaping the technological landscape.\n\nIn conclusion, it’s clear that AI, ML technologies, along with 5G, edge computing, and quantum computing will shape the upcoming years, driving advancements across various sectors of the tech industry.\n\nKeeping up with the tech trends 2024 with Near Partner\n\nElevate your business with a trusted partner – with Near Partner. Our phenomenal team can help you and your business stay ahead of the tech curve by embracing the latest trends like AI, cloud computing, and IoT.\n\nWe strive to deliver tailored solutions that empower growth and efficiency, allowing business owners to focus on the business part.\n\nWe are ready for the challenge, are you?\n\nGet in touch with Near Partner\n\n, and let us work together to bring your vision to life.",

    "content": "They’re two prime contenders for the title of best mobile development platform.\n\nBut which is best for each case? Check who wins the Flutter vs React Native battle.\n\nFlutter and React Native are two leading open-source frameworks for\n\nmobile app development\n\n. Each has a unique set of advantages and a few limitations. Flutter comes packed with a UI toolkit that powers customised apps with a unified look across devices. React apps, on the other hand, have a more native look and feel on each platform and rely on native components, ensuring a more platform-specific experience.\n\nBut which is best? In this side-by-side comparison of Flutter vs React Native, we’ll explore the similarities and differences of both frameworks, and hopefully by the end of it, you’ll be able to make an informed decision for your next mobile app project. And if you enjoy side-by-sides, be sure to check out our other two side-by-side comparisons:\n\nReact vs Angular\n\nand Vue vs React!\n\nWhat is Flutter?\n\nFlutter\n\nis a development framework with an extensive set of tools, libraries, and widgets. It is used mainly for mobile development, but its capabilities extend to web and desktop applications. Flutter was developed by Google in 2017, and it now one of the most popular cross-platform development framework.\n\nWhat is React Native?\n\nReact Native was developed by Facebook in 2015 and is also a cross-platform mobile development framework. React Native relies on\n\nJavaScript, one of the most popular programming languages\n\n, to create native apps for iOS and Android.\n\nAnd now, on to the comparison.\n\nFlutter vs React Native: side by side comparison\n\nProgramming Language winner: depends\n\n!\n\nFlutter uses Dart\n\n, a language with C-style syntax, developed by Google in 2011. Dart compiles to machine code, JavaScript, or WebAssembly.\n\nReact Native uses JavaScript and JSX\n\n(JavaScript XML, an extension of JavaScript that allows you to write HTML in React). DEpending on which programming language your team is more comfortable with,  you may want to choose one framework or the other.\n\nPerformance winner: React Native\n\nPrior to 2022, React Native relied on a bridge to allow JavaScript to communicate with native modules. This was a drawback in terms of performance, as it could lead to some overhead (essentially more resources and computation time), latency, and others. In 2022, a new layer was introduced to React Native, JSI (JavaScript Interface) which is now the middleman between JavaScript and native elements. This change improved performance in React Native. Flutter, on the other hand, compiles to native machine code, and although the gap in performance in Flutter vs React Native is very narrow,\n\nFlutter apps are still slightly faster than React Native apps.\n\nLearning Curve winner: React Native\n\nReact Native is easy to get started with, and even more with prior knowledge of JavaScript. Flutter uses Dart, which is a whole other language. So, the\n\nlearning curve is definitely steeper for Flutter\n\n.\n\nScalability winner: it’s a tie!\n\nTough one. Both Flutter and React Native are very scalable, and it is difficult to point one of them as better than the other. Plus, it’s not only in their hands; scalability depends greatly on the design and architecture of an app, API backend, as well as the overall\n\nbackend system\n\n. It is possible to ruin an apps scalability with a monolithic architecture – try\n\nevent-driven architecture\n\ninstead! – inefficient database queries, and so on, and those don’t depend on mobile frameworks exactly. So, to settle the question of Flutter vs React Native scalability, we’ll consider it a tie.\n\nEase of Use winner: React Native\n\nReact Native is much easier and faster to install and start using than Flutter. On the other hand, Flutter has a comprehensive, pre-built and proprietary widgets, while React Native relies on third-party libraries. Flutter’s widgets aren’t adaptive, and need to be configured manually, while React Native is pretty much self-adaptive – that is, using Flutter, developers need to make platform-specific configurations manually, and they don’t with React Native. For that reason, and because the learning curve is steeper in Flutter, even with its easy installation,\n\nReact Native is easier to use than Flutter\n\n.\n\nUI Development\n\nwinner: Flutter\n\nFlutter has a very rich set of customisable widgets and offers a high degree of control over the UI. In fact, Flutter’s UI Design is very consistent across platforms, allowing for a unified look and feel of one app on both Android and iOS. It also compiles to native code, which can contribute to a more polished UI due to smooth animations, for example. In terms of UI Development, React Native allows more customisation but relies more on native components for complex UI elements. While both can create excellent UIs, we choose Flutter for UI Development.\n\nCommunity Support winner: React Native\n\nReact Native absolutely takes the prize here. More mature and JavaScript-based, React Native has a large and well-established community, with vast libraries and third-party packages, and plenty of documentation. Now, Flutter has a growing community although way smaller than React Native’s. It also has an impeccably organised and structured documentation compared to React Native which, being reliant on third-party libraries, has poorly maintained documentation. The winner is clear:\n\nReact Native has larger community and support.\n\nTesting and Debugging winner: Flutter\n\nFlutter offers a comprehensive development environment called Flutter DevTools with specific tools for testing, debugging, profiling, and monitoring. React Native uses the standard debugging tools for JavaScript like Jest, ChromeDevTools and a wide range of third-party libraries. Because of this,\n\nFlutter’s test & debug integrated tools are more appreciated\n\n.\n\nPlatform Support winner: Flutter\n\nReact Native primarily supports iOS and Android, but can be extended to other platforms using third-party libraries – such as Expo, that extends React Native to support web and\n\nPWA development\n\nbesides traditional mobile app development. Flutter, however, supports iOS, Android, web, and desktop (Windows, macOS, and Linux). Therefore,\n\nFlutter has better platform support than React Native\n\n.\n\nApp Type winner: depends!\n\nFlutter and React Native are excellent frameworks. However, they are each more suited for different types of apps. Flutter might do better for apps with\n\ncustom UI/UX\n\nsuch as\n\ne-commerce\n\n,\n\nmedia streaming\n\n, and apps that demand\n\nunique designs\n\n; it also works well for\n\n2D games\n\n,\n\nstartup prototypes\n\nand\n\nmulti-platform apps.\n\nReact Native may be best for apps that require consistent\n\nnative UX\n\n, content display-focused apps like\n\nnews readers\n\n,\n\nblogs\n\n, and\n\ninformational\n\ncontent\n\n, and even\n\nsocial media\n\nand apps that rely on\n\nreal-time data updates\n\n.\n\nFlutter vs React Native: the verdict\n\nLet’s see which of these cross-platform mobile development framework is best for your project:\n\nSo, what is the winner of this Flutter vs React Native contest for you? As always, it’s impossible to declare an absolute winner without the proper context of the project at hand, dev team expertise, timeline, third-party integration needs and such.\n\nStill on the fence about Flutter vs React Native?\n\nAt Near Partner, we can help you understand what framework is best for your business, and work with you and your team to achieve the perfect solution that satisfies your business’ needs.

    "content": "DevOps is growing at breakneck speed, leaving managers and developers\n\nwondering “what next?\n\n”.\n\nThese are the hottest DevOps to watch out for.\n\nIt wasn’t that long ago that those in Development had a very hard time figuring out what was going on inside the Operations department. You might be struggling with the same issue yourself. After all, until recently no one had quite figured out how to work differently without creating more problems than they solved. That is, until DevOps came along.\n\nIn 2009, Patrick Debois coined the term after watching a lecture with the prescient name: “10+ Deploys a Day: Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr”. He reckoned the lecture wasn’t about a process, a technology, or a standard. What was especially tantalizing was the combination of “development” and “operations,” – hence the name “DevOps” – which amounted to a whole new way of working, in what has since been dubbed as a new organizational culture.\n\nBy adopting a DevOps culture, with its underlying practices and tools, early adopters like PayPal, Intel or Facebook gained the ability to respond better to customer needs, increased confidence in the applications they created, and achieved business objectives faster. After years of iterations, DevOps’s goals remained mostly unchanged: deliver better, more reliable products.\n\nFast forward to 2023 and the global market value of DevOps\n\nhas reached 10.85 billion dollars.\n\nForecasts predict the DevOps market to have a steep increase to around 24 billion dollars over the next four years. After such breakneck growth, it is worth asking the multi-billion dollar question: where is DevOps headed?\n\nWhat is DevOps?\n\nDevOps is a set of principles, strategies, and work philosophies that focus on a streamlined communication and collaboration between the development team (Devs) and the operations team (Ops) in a business. It was influenced by several software development and management methodologies, like\n\nAgile\n\n, Lean, and\n\nExtreme Programming (XP)\n\n.\n\nTop DevOps tools to watch out for\n\nFrom its early days until right now, this transformative approach to software development and IT has evolved, improved, and shaped the technology landscape. What about from now on? The answer might well be within these key DevOps tools.\n\nContainerization tools\n\nContainers are lightweight, standalone, and executable packages that contain everything needed to run a piece of software, such as code, runtime, libraries, and system tools. Containers make it easier to develop, test, and deploy applications.\n\nThat being said, one of the containerization DevOps tools for 2024 to keep an eye on is definitely\n\nDocker\n\n. Docker\n\nis a popular container-based platform for developing, packaging, and running applications within containers. It allows you to test apps locally before deploying to your preferred environment.\n\nThere are plenty of other very relevant tools in the Containerization space, but few more than Kubernetes. With a laser focus on automating the deployment and scaling, it is currently the leading tool in this category, acclaimed left and right for its support of hybrid and multi-cloud deployments.\n\nContinuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)\n\nContinuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools automate and streamline the software development pipeline, from code integration to deployment. CI/CD tools speed up release cycles by ensuring that code changes are integrated, tested, and delivered, resulting in more reliable software.\n\nThe names to keep in mind are\n\nJenkins\n\n, a Java-based tool now compatible with a range of plugins that extend its use to other languages, and\n\nGitLab CI/CD\n\n, a tool integrated in the end-to-end DevOps GitLab platform.\n\nContainer Security\n\nContainer security DevOps tools safeguard containerized applications and infrastructure from vulnerabilities, threats, and breaches, maintaining\n\ndata integrity\n\nand security. Some containerization tools include their own security solutions, like Docker (\n\nDocker Security Scanning\n\n).\n\nBut there some very relevant DevOps tools to watch out for.\n\nClair\n\nfocuses on container image security.\n\nAqua Security\n\nscans container images for vulnerabilities and enforces security policies.\n\nTwistlock\n\noffers runtime protection for containers.\n\nSysdig\n\nprovides container monitoring and security insights and\n\nFalco\n\n, an open-source project, offers runtime security and behavioural monitoring for containers.\n\nObservability tools\n\nObservability DevOps tools are used to gain insights into the performance and behaviour of applications and infrastructure in real-time, as well as and troubleshooting complex, distributed systems. In short, they help DevOps teams ensure system reliability and performance.\n\nThe top Observability DevOps tools for 2024 include solutions like\n\nPrometheus\n\nfor monitoring and collecting metrics,\n\nGrafana\n\nfor visualization, and\n\nNew Relic\n\nfor application performance monitoring. O\n\nth\n\ner relevant DevOps tools are Splunk for data logging, and Dynatrace\n\nfor AIOp\n\ns\n\n.\n\nNear Partner, your partner in implementing DevOps at scale\n\nReady to enter the next year with the right foot, and take your software project to the next level?

    "content": "Apple Vision Pro has been in development for over a decade. Now the wait is over.\n\nThis is what to expect from the Apple Vision Pro and th\n\ne\n\nall\n\nnew\n\nVisionOS\n\n.\n\nCould you be tempted? Watch your favourite shows on a screen larger than your house, while sitting on a lunar landscape. Present your slide deck as if you were giving a TED talk, rather than Zooming it. Forgo your screen, laptop and keyboard, and use your hands and eyes instead to navigate, select and click. That, and much more, is the appeal of Apple’s “biggest release since the iPhone” (their words): the new Vision Pro headset.\n\nSource: Apple\n\nBut is the Vision Pro, Apple’s latest dip into Mixed Reality, about to usher in a new era of “spatial computing” (again, according to Apple) or will it join the ranks of other high-flying, but ultimately flawed ideas, from Google’s goggles to Meta’s own VR headset? And can it really change the way we work, communicate and interact with technology, in a world where the fight for talent and “back to the office” are gaining ground? Let’s see what the hype is all about.\n\nApple Vision Pro: the new “reality”\n\nMixed Reality (MR) is a technology somewhere between Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). While the term “VR” usually refers to a completely computer-generated environment, where the “real world” is blocked, “AR” is an environment where reality is augmented – or aided – by virtual elements such as graphics, sounds and audio, and tactile sensations. MR is essentially a blend between the real and virtual worlds, where elements of the physical and virtual world can interact. This is where you can find the new Apple Pro Vision.\n\nTotal AR / VR headset shipments are expected to grow. Source:\n\nMint\n\nBy the way, Apple is not alone in its push for other realities: Microsoft HoloLens 2, HTC Vive Focus 3, and Meta’s Quest Pro headset, scheduled to for release the very same day, already make for a very competitive landscape. And it could just the start.\n\nBut what makes the Apple Vision Pro different from past attempts to convince users to join an alternative semi- digital universe? Apple certainly thinks so and\n\nestimates to surpass a 20 million user base in the first 5 years\n\n.\n\nApple device shipments forecast by category (mn units). Source:\n\nM.G. Siegler\n\nFirst, let’s talk specs: the Apple Vision Pro features two ultra-high-res micro-OLED displays that deliver a combined 23 million pixels – more than a 4K TV for each eye – with wide colour, high dynamic range, and Dolby Vision. It also features a new R1 chip, custom designed for the Apple Vision Pro headset, processes input from the cameras, sensors, and microphones for a lag-free, real-time experience.\n\nThe new MR headset will run on the new Apple operating system powered by the Apple M2 processor and a new operating system, VisionOS, which supports a wide range of apps, including games, educational apps, and productivity tools. VisionOs comes with its new, dedicated\n\napp store\n\n. Apple’s headset features precise head, hand, and eye tracking technology via more than 12 dedicated sensors. The list of tech specs goes and on and on, making this the cutting edge in MR headset technology. The question remains, what does it all mean for users – and how can brands tap into its possibilities?\n\nGet to know\n\n7 transformative use cases of AI for app development\n\n.\n\nApplications and use cases\n\nThe big promise of Apple Vision Pro is to merge together the “real” and the virtual worlds together – one enhancing the other. It can be used for a variety of purposes, including entertainment (say watching your favourite shows while on a plane on a huge screen) or work (goodbye multiple screen, hello immersive work meetings).\n\nSome potential use cases for companies with Apple Vision Pro are:\n\nRemote Training and Education\n\n: there’s a whole untapped potential for enhancing education with MR. We’re talking studying anatomy and physiology via AI-powered simulations, without the need to dissect cadavers, chemistry experiments in controlled environments, or even personalised learning experiences for students with special needs.\n\nImmersive Shopping and Enhanced Retail:\n\nvirtual try-on experiences and interactive product demonstrations might as well not be a thing of the future. Combining the power of online and in-store shopping can make the whole experience more engaging and convenient.\n\nHealthcare and Therapy:\n\nfrom augmented reality-enhanced medical Imaging to therapy tools for patients with neurological conditions, healthcare will surely benefit from a myriad of innovative solutions.\n\nTravel and Exploration:\n\noverlaying virtual information on real-world environments is just one of many, many ways Apple Vision Pro could enhance a travel experience, along with real-time language assistance or even with extending accessibility to people with disabilities.\n\nDoes\n\nyour business need AI or Machine Leaning\n\n?\n\nMR tools such as the Apple Vision Pro can be used to create\n\neffective training experiences\n\nfor employees to learn new skills, competences, and procedures in safe and realistic environments. At the same time, they can enable\n\nmore efficient remote work\n\nby providing workers with a shared and collaborative virtual workspace where they can see and talk to each other, share files, and interact with virtual objects. Similarly, the\n\ncustomer experience\n\ncan be enhanced with interactive product demos, virtual showrooms, or interactive, real-time customer service.\n\nBut other areas – such as\n\nfield service and maintenance –\n\ncan also benefit greatly from real-time technical guidance and instructions as workers interact with machinery and other equipment, or even\n\nproduct design and development departments\n\n, which can use MR to create realistic 3D models and prototypes and interact with them.\n\nBut the real opportunity here is for businesses who dare to be pioneers in the development of MR software and applications. Like almost always, the early adopters of MR technologies like Apple Vision Pro will probably not only shape its future but also reap the most significant rewards.\n\nLimitations and challenges\n\nPriced at a hefty US$3,499, the Apple Vision Pro headset is most definitely not an affordable, everyday solution yet for the majority of consumers. For businesses, the main challenge is the effort and cost associated with developing and deploying Apple Vision Pro-compatible solutions like VisionOS apps. Furthermore, there are still some questions about comfort, wearability, eye strain, potential side effects on health and wellbeing, accessibility, and others.\n\nPreparing your business for Apple Vision Pro\n\nIf you are considering taking advantage of not only Apple Vision Pro but more widely MR tech, there are a few things you can do to prepare\n\n.\n\nAs mentioned, Apple Vision Pro apps run on VisionOS, meaning any iOS app will most likely have to be adapted, and for other operative systems they may need to be totally adapted.\n\nAlso, your teams\n\nwill most likely need training on how to use Apple Vision Pro and on the specificities of the OS.",

    "content": "Get to know the power of Client Relationship Management.\n\nCustomer loyalty garners considerable buzz—and for good reason. Building a base of repeat customers is far less costly than acquiring new ones, making it a pivotal goal for any business. Yet, despite its importance, loyalty remains notoriously elusive; it’s difficult to define, challenging to measure, and even harder to achieve. Years might be spent perfecting tools, designing processes, and assembling a top-tier team, only to find the pinnacle of consumer connection frustratingly just beyond grasp.\n\nThe difficulty lies in the ever-evolving nature of consumer expectations and the complex dynamics of trust and satisfaction. As markets shift and new trends surface, maintaining and measuring loyalty becomes akin to aiming at a moving target: always changing and perpetually out of reach. Traditional market KPIs like customer satisfaction surveys and Net Promoter Scores provide some insight, but they often miss the breadth and depth of true loyalty.\n\nThe secret to unlocking loyalty lies in forging a relationship that transcends transactions. It’s a bond that resonates with customers on a deeper level. But how can a business effectively manage and enhance every interaction with every customer? Dive deeper into the strategies that drive successful Client Relationship Management to find out.\n\nWhat is Client Relationship Management?\n\nClient Relationship Management is a set of processes and practices to manage their company-client relationships. It includes every interaction between a business and their customers (or potential customers), starting at the very first contact with the brand. Tracking sales, leads, opportunities, marketing campaigns and past communications are all part of Client Relationship Management. Another, perhaps more useful, definition could be that Client Relationship Management is about building strong relationships. And this type of account management that\n\ngoes far beyond admin tools and focuses on providing personalised service, understanding and meeting customer needs.\n\nCustomer Relationship Management may take on different forms for diverse kinds of business, or even for different sized companies. However, in the end, it all comes down to one single thing: building client loyalty and trust.\n\nWhy is Client Relationship Management important?\n\nClient Relationship Management is extremely important for companies, because it allows businesses to create meaningful relationships with customers.\n\nCustomer Retention\n\nLet’s face it, in a world with 8 billion people, chances are your product or service is not unique, or in other words: you have competition. Sometimes the difference between two businesses isn’t exactly on the product or service itself, but on building strong relationships with their customers. Besides, acquiring new clients is expensive, more expensive than retaining existing ones. In fact, several studies and reports point to\n\nanywhere between five and twenty five times more\n\n. A good Client Relationship Management strategy allows businesses to turn one-time buyers into repeat customers, increasing customer retention rates.\n\nCustomer Satisfaction\n\nHappy customers become repeat customers, and repeat customers become loyal – the kind that not only chooses your business but also actively advocates for and recommends your business to others. A Client Relationship Management allows businesses to nurture this cycle of “happy, repeat” by employing tools and processes such as customer data analysis, or targeted lead nurturing strategies to deliver exceptional\n\ncustomer journeys\n\n.\n\nIncreased Sales\n\nOn the one hand, a solid Client Relationship Management can help your business identify sales opportunities and better pursue leads and close deals, thus\n\nincreasing sales\n\n. On the other, satisfied customers spend more, and loyal customers are the top spenders. A Client Relationship Management strategy can help businesses increase their sales by helping foster meaningful relationships with customers and turn these relationships into long-term affairs.\n\nHow to implement Client Relationship Management\n\nImplementing a Client Relationship Management strategy offers a multitude of advantages that ultimately propelling businesses towards long-term success. But how can you implement a Client Relationship Management strategy the right way? There are a few best-practices and key responsabilities to keep in mind.\n\nGather Quality Data\n\nGreat Client Relationship Management requires great data. Most of this data comes from different sources (sales records, marketing campaigns, customer support interactions) and is spread over several channels (\n\nonline store\n\n, social media, email). It is important to ensure data is both relevant and accurate. And while the former can be achieved via some sort of data cleansing to eliminate duplicates and residuals, who better than the customers themselves to ensure data accuracy?\n\nWhat to do\n\nGather contact information, purchase history, preferences, and past interactions – keeping privacy settings and GDPR in mind\n\nNormalize your databases, especially if they are spread across different comms channels\n\nRegularly clean and update your databases\n\nEncourage your customers to provide up-to-date information through user-friendly self-service options.\n\nTrack Key Metrics\n\nDon’t just collect data. Put it to use! Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) such as customer satisfaction scores, sales conversion rates or lead nurturing engagement. Then, monitor them regularly in order to assess the effectiveness of your strategy and to identify areas for improvement.\n\nWhat to do\n\nFocus on top key metrics and update them regularly (daily or weekly)\n\nSet clear goals for each metric and track deviations\n\nMake sure every team member is focused on the same KPIs and share progress with the team\n\nBuild Personalise Experiences\n\nCustomization enhances\n\ncustomer experiences\n\nand fosters connection between client and brand. With data on customer behaviour and preferences, one of businesses’ key responsabilities is to tailor their communication to be more relevant and valuable to individual clients, for example in the form of targeted email marketing campaigns, personalised product recommendations, or even customised service offerings based on specific needs.\n\nWhat to do\n\nMap the existing customer experience step-by-step, including every interaction with the brand\n\nIdentify the points in the customer experience where it the cost / impact of customization is greater\n\nAsk for first-hand client satisfaction actively through surveys, reviews or even one-on-one conversations, to understand what expectations they have\n\nBrainstorm ideas to customize customer experience with your team\n\nImplement and evaluate customer satisfaction\n\nStrive for Exceptional Customer Service\n\nEvery business says they focus on the Customer. But what does it mean? Great account management starting point is solving issues in a way that is satisfactory to the client but it is also about creating great experiences customers won’t forget. Consistent and high-quality customer service ensures customers have a positive experience when interacting with the company, and this fosters organic growth.\n\nWhat to do\n\nIdentify recurring issues and train staff on how to troubleshoot them\n\nMake sure your customer service team is responsive, knowledgeable, and empathetic when dealing with customers\n\nTeach staff how to create rapport and how to make customers feel they went the extra-mile\n\nSetup variable reward systems to your team based on customer feedback\n\nReward customers for their loyalty with personalised greetings, exclusive discounts, or with a simple expression of gratitude for their business\n\nChoose a CRM Software that works for your business\n\nWhile a strong strategy is essential, the right software can significantly enhance its effectiveness and simplify its implementation. A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software is a powerful platform that streamlines your Client Relationship Management strategy and empowers your team to cultivate stronger client relationships. A CRM software acts as a centralized client data hub, which can\n\nintegrate with other tools, platforms, and systems\n\n, and goes beyond storing data.\n\nWhat to do:\n\nAnalyse the business and technical needs for the CRM\n\nCompare the pros and cons of the options available in the market – or consider building your own from scratch\n\nBeware of shadow IT, meaning the files that spring out from indivual efforts to improve, as they can lead to poor performance, process variation, and security risks\n\nClient Relationship Management with Salesforce\n\nSalesforce is the number one CRM platform in the world, trusted by millions of business users. Renowned for its robust features and ability to harmonise all aspects of your client interactions, Salesforce is a dynamic hub for all business-client interactions, where every department – sales,\n\nmarketing\n\n, customer service – is in sync, sharing and exchanging info seamlessly.\n\nHere are some of its key benefits:\n\nEnhanced communication:\n\nSalesforce acts as a communication hub allowing the various teams in your business to collaborate across channels within the platform;\n\nIncreased efficiency:\n\nSalesforce automates workflows like lead generation, appointment scheduling, and follow-up emails. It frees up time your teams can use to build personal relationships with customers.\n\nImproved data quality:\n\nbesides collecting meaningful data from customers and customer interactions, Salesforce analyses that data and, with the help of\n\ninnovative built-in AI-based tools\n\n, provides insights into customer behaviour, preferences and market trends. This allows you to tailor campaigns, personalise experiences and to make data-driven decisions for the success of your business.\n\nFlexible scalability:\n\nSalesforce is a cloud-based solution that scales with your business. It can accommodate your expanding client base and growing complexity, ensuring your CRM remains a powerful tool throughout your growth journey.\n\nHowever, implementing a Client Relationship Management strategy and navigating the complexities of a new CRM platform – even one as intuitive and straight-forwards as Salesforce – while continuing business as usual at the office can be daunting.

    "content": "Ready for something new? These are 10 programming languages on\n\nthe rise right now that can redefine your next project.\n\nThe podium of the most popular programming languages has been disputed for years between Python,\n\nJavaScript\n\nand Java. They compete fiercely and share the top 10 with programming languages such as C, C++, C#, PHP, SQL, TypeScript and HTML/\n\nCSS\n\n.\n\nIn some cases, these “giants” served as the basis for new programming languages. In others, a whole new language just pops up and takes the coding world by surprise. With some 9.000 programming languages created so far and between 700 – 2000 (depending on the source) in current use today, there is plenty to choose from depending on the use case and app.\n\nWhat differentiates programming languages from each other?\n\nEach programming language has its own syntax, keywords, and purpose that may not work with others or in different frameworks. But more generally, programming languages can be described by\n\nlevel\n\nand\n\ntype\n\n.\n\nLow-level programming languages:\n\na low-level language shows a low abstraction from the computer instruction architecture, which means it’s closer to machine language than human language. Examples of low-level programming languages (with varying levels of abstraction) are Fortran, C, Cobol, Assembly, and Basic.\n\nHigh-level programming languages:\n\na high-level language has a stronger abstraction from the machine’s language and is closer to a human language. This means that its syntax includes words that humans can read and is then more intelligible. Examples of high-level programming languages are JavaScript, Python, C++, C#, or Java.\n\nAnd now, the real question: what are currently the hottest trending programming languages?\n\n10 programming languages on the rise\n\nGet to know 10 of the programming languages that are on the rise right now.\n\nGo\n\nGo is an open-sourced high-level language created in 2009 by Google. It was built for speed, and is usually used for building web servers, data pipelines and machine-learning packages, as well as AI and data science processes. Go is used by companies like Dropbox, Google, SoundCloud and Twitch.\n\nSwift\n\nApple developed the Swift programming language in 2010 and released it in 2014. With a concise syntax, Swift is used for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. Uber, Glovo, Asana, and DoorDash all use Swift.\n\nF#\n\nF# – or F sharp – is gaining traction as competitor of Python, since it is an open-source, cross-platform, performance-driven programming language. F# was developed in 2005 by Microsoft and, just like Python, can be used for building and designing applications and games, for data science, scientific research, and also for AI. Walmart, Jet.com and Olo are some of the companies using F# in their stack.\n\nElixir\n\nElixir came about in 2012, as a programming language that runs on the Erlang Virtual Machine, BEAM. It was heavily influenced by Ruby on Rails, having been created exactly to address its shortcomings, and designed to handle large data volumes. Elixir is now on the rise, especially on the telco, eCommerce, and finance industries. PepsiCo, Spotify, WhatsApp and Discord are some of the giants using Elixir.\n\nKotlin\n\nKotlin is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language created in 2011. Kotlin runs seamlessly on Java Virtual Machine and was designed to simplify Android application development. According to Google’s Android Studio, Kotlin is used\n\nby over 60% of Android developers\n\n. Besides mobile, Kotlin is also used for Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality applications. Pinterest, Trello and Amazon are some of the companies using Kotlin.\n\nR\n\nR is a programming language created in 1993 for statistical computing, graphics programming, and\n\ndata analytics\n\n. It is used in a number of industries to visualize and analyze large volumes of data, like fintech, retail, and healthcare. Despite being a veteran, R’s popularity is increasing steadily, and there is a shortage of tech talent with expertise in R. Companies like Amazon, Google, and LinkedIn use R in their stacks.\n\nRuby\n\nRuby, developed in 1995 in Japan, is an interpreted, dynamic, open-source programming language with a diverse range of use cases. It is used for data-driven web applications, marketplaces, and desktop applications. Ruby is simple, productive and has elegant syntax, and is the basis for the popular web app framework Ruby on Rails that extends Ruby language. Some companies using Ruby are Airbnb, CouchSurfing, Shopify and Twitter.\n\nRust\n\nRust was created in 2020 by Firefox, to address some vulnerabilities of C++. It is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language, with a focus on speed and security, able to handle substantial amounts of data. Being the true baby of this list, the learning curve of Rust may be a bit steeper than other programming languages. Companies like Dropbox, Firefox, Cloudflare, and more recently Meta, Amazon, or Microsoft utilise Rust for diverse operations where speed, security and scalability are needed.\n\nDart\n\nDart has been around since 2011, thanks to Google. Dart is used to develop web, mobile, server and desktop applications, and has lately been very popular in IoT applications as well. Dart has C-like syntax and compiles to machine code, JavaScript, or WebAssembly.

    "content": "(and people are only as good as they are able to execute)\n\nSometimes you have something that seems like a great idea, but when you see it implemented it sucks. Turns out that, when put in practice, the idea was not that good after all. Other times, the idea looks good (and probably it is) but the way it’s implemented doesn’t accomplish what was expected (“Plans are useless, but planning is indispensable”).\n\nA good idea can’t survive bad execution, while a reasonable idea, if well executed, can become a very good thing!\n\nAs an example, we can think about many products which are similar to existing ones except they were very much better executed; or have a much better design; or a much better user experience; or were better marketed, presented to the public and “packaged” in a way or time when it made sense.\n\nOn the other hand, you have great ideas who don’t become great business successes. Either because there’s not a perfect market fit or because they are not appealing enough. I know what I’m talking about. I’ve been on both sides and tasted the proverbial sour taste of unsuccess with what looked like remarkable ideas.\n\nPeople, their potential, and their skills\n\nThis thought came back to me again recently, when a good friend of mine achieved a formidable goal in his professional life. He delivered big time! With it, I began thinking about people, their potential, and their skills. As we talked, we discussed the success of the operation he was involved in. We talked about how good it was for him, for the people he works with and for his organisation. And the parallel between people and ideas in terms of implementation became obvious.\n\nWith people, the aforementioned aphorism is also true. Someone’s potential is there to be harvested, but it has to mature, develop, be worked on, find the right opportunity, learn more and keep on doing – the idea isn’t real until it’s put into practice, right? As with ideas, there’s a lot of work (and it has to be the right work) involved in becoming a better person and a better professional.\n\nAccording to several studies, many times the people who are successful and happy are not those you think “that have it all”. To be successful it’s not necessary to be extraordinarily smart. Many times, if you think back at your school days, those who were “set for success” are not the ones who get there at the end of the day. As Gary Kasparov put it, “aptitude to play chess is just aptitude to play chess. Nothing else.”\n\n“If you have a high level of intelligence as predicted by IQ test scores, you have great capacity or potential. But if it’s not used in ways that fulfill you psychologically, it’s not likely that you will become a total success.”\n\nHaving three kids in school age the reasons for personal happiness and success are something I think a lot.\n\nWhat makes some people succeed and be happy, even if sometimes it seems they’re bound for it while they are young?\n\nWhy, so many times, the bright young kids who excel in school are not that successful when they grow up? Is it school and our educational system? Is it something that happens in their family context? Is there something we can do, as parents, to foster our kids’ abilities to be successful?\n\nWhat is success?\n\nLet me be clear on one thing: I’m not only talking about economic success. That might be one part. But it is not the whole story. I’m talking about making sure that one’s economics are enough to sustain the lifestyle that makes that person happy. As one friend of mine puts it: “It’s not being rich today. It’s not being poor tomorrow [considering the lifestyle that one wants / likes to have]”.\n\nAlthough I said this is not only about financial success, many successful people were also accomplished economically. It’s interesting to understand what they thought were the factors that led them to their success.\n\nSome studies from self-reporting successful people had them listing these top 10 factors:\n\nBeing honest with all people\n\nBeing well disciplined\n\nGetting along with people\n\nHaving a supportive spouse\n\nWorking harder than most people\n\nLoving my career/business\n\nHaving strong leadership qualities\n\nHaving a very competitive spirit/personality\n\nBeing very well organized\n\nHaving an ability to sell my ideas/products\n\nIt’s suggestive to notice that most of these qualities are learnt during your education but are not school subjects. And it’s also interesting that you don’t find any reference to the grades or the level of knowledge they learned on their educational path. On this particular aspect it is relevant that factors of that kind were considered much less important. For instance, “attending a top-rated college” was only the 23rd factor by these successful people’s classification and “Graduating near / at top of my class” was the 30th.\n\nObviously, this does not mean these are not important factors, or that whatever you learn in school or which school you attend is irrelevant. It only gives us a view on some other factors which are also important (for this survey sample at least).\n\nThinking about this I realized that people sometimes live by the expectations they create instead of fulfilling their potential. I know so many people who never moved beyond their potential. Who never really executed it. I could not avoid the idea of intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation and considering that it might play a larger role than what our society considers most of the time.\n\nBut that was not the case with my friend I talked about in the beginning of this post. He delivered. Congratulations! Well-deserved success.",

    "content": "Low-Code promises faster development at a fraction of the cost with\n\nno concessions on quality. See how it enhances your field!\n\nLow-code solutions are seriously shaking things up in many industries. This is a world where coding is optional, apps are deployed in weeks rather than months, and everyone can chip in on innovative products. Sure, low-code breaks down many of the challenges of traditional development, making operations smoother than ever, at a fraction of the budget and time-to-market.\n\nBut how can you truly implement low-code into your business? Here are some examples:\n\nBanking\n\nHealthcare\n\nEducation\n\nGovernment\n\nRetail\n\n1. Banking\n\nKey take-aways: smooth integration of legacy systems with new digital solutions, addresses compliance concerns like KYC processes, automate tasks and ensure regulatory requirements, help navigate regulations while improving customer experiences.\n\nCan low-code help banks become more digital? Is the technology mature enough to ensure seamless operations and exceptional customer experiences?\n\nThere is little arguing that updating legacy systems on which customers rely for their everyday lives is a formidable challenge. Yet, low-code’s transformative force offers a rapid and efficient solutions.\n\nTake, for example, the ease with each you can use connectors and APIs to bridge the gap between the old and the new, facilitating a smooth transition towards more customer-centric and technologically advanced digital banking experiences.\n\nEnhance customer experience and regulatory compliance\n\nCustomer-centric challenges further manifest in the realm of\n\nmobile app development\n\n, where the demand for swift updates and feature releases poses significant obstacles for traditional banking institutions.\n\nLow-code solutions come to the rescue by accelerating the development lifecycle of mobile applications. With their agility and flexibility, low-code platforms empower banks to swiftly adapt to evolving customer expectations, ensuring their mobile banking apps remain competitive and aligned with the latest industry trends.\n\nAdditionally, low-code proves instrumental in addressing compliance-related concerns, automating complex\n\nKnow Your Customer (KYC)\n\nprocesses, and streamlining customer onboarding.\n\nBy creating customized low-code applications, banks can navigate\n\nregulatory requirements\n\nwith ease, maintaining compliance while enhancing the overall customer journey. These solutions, ranging from\n\nfraud detection applications\n\nto\n\npersonalized customer experience\n\nplatforms, position low-code as a cornerstone for overcoming the multifaceted challenges in the digital banking sector.\n\n2. Healthcare\n\nKey take-aways: automate processes, broad view of patient date, improving care coordination, enable better-informed decision-making, address compliance concerns.\n\nIf one industry can truly push the power of low-code, it has to be healthcare, where lives are on the line.  Still, this is an industry where paper-based, error prone processes remain, contributing to inefficiencies and delays – which impact patient outcomes.\n\nThe average time a doctor spends with each patient has been getting shorter in recent years\n\n. Around 13-16 minutes the most common amount of time per shift physicians spend with patients – even if most physicians consider their relationship with patients the most rewarding aspect of their practices. For nurses, those numbers are naturally higher,\n\nbut still only around 30% of their time on unit was spent in patient rooms\n\n. The rest, well, you guessed it: admin tasks.\n\nLow-code solutions can help healthcare providers develop applications that automate processes, such as patient information management, appointment scheduling, and data analytics.\n\nThe flexibility of low-code platforms enables healthcare organizations to adapt quickly to changing requirements and modernize their operations without the protracted timelines associated with traditional software development. By\n\ncreating interconnected platforms\n\n, healthcare providers can achieve a broad view of patient data, improving care coordination, and enabling better-informed decision-making.\n\nEvery healthcare provide must adhere to stringent regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Low-code applications can be tailored to address these compliance concerns, ensuring that healthcare organizations live by regulatory requirements while maintaining the agility to adapt to future changes.\n\n3. Education\n\nKey take-aways: Administrative efficiency, adaptation to the dynamic needs of both in-person and virtual learning scenarios, technology aligns seamlessly with evolving academic standards.\n\nOn average,\n\njust 46 percent of a teacher’s time is spent teaching\n\n. The rest is spent on admin tasks – like grading tests, collaborating/planning with colleagues or communicating with parents. One prevalent issue is the often cumbersome and outdated systems for\n\nstudent information management\n\nand\n\ncourse scheduling\n\n, which become even more pronounced in the context of hybrid and remote learning environments.\n\nBut what if you could create solutions to simplify student enrollment, grade tracking, and course scheduling? With low-code platforms, you can. Educational institutions can promote administrative efficiency and adapt to the dynamic needs of both in-person and virtual learning scenarios.\n\nFurthermore, the ever-changing landscape of curricular requirements demands a flexible approach to application development, particularly when catering to diverse learning modalities. Low-code solutions offer educational institutions the\n\nagility to quickly adapt to curriculum changes\n\n, ensuring that technology aligns seamlessly with evolving academic standards.\n\n4. Government\n\nKey take-aways: payment processing made easier, enhance transparency, alleviate administrative burdens, enhance communication and efficiency in services.\n\nPublic services and administration face serious challenges.\n\nA primary one is bureaucracy and slow decision-making processes that often characterize governmental operations, impacting crucial services. For instance, city approval workflows can be made easiers with low-code. So can\n\npayment processing, and communication with citizens\n\n, thereby enhancing transparency and alleviating administrative burdens.\n\nIn the context of labour market resources and career planning, low-code applications can be tailored to provide citizens with\n\neasy access to employment opportunities, career guidance, and training programs\n\n. These platforms empower government agencies to offer comprehensive and user-friendly resources to the public, fostering a more dynamic and responsive labour market.\n\nAddressing the challenge of communication and collaboration among government agencies and with citizens is another crucial challenge. Low-code applications can help build\n\ncustomized platforms that enhance communication channels and collaboration tools\n\n, enabling government agencies to maintain seamless interactions, promoting transparency and efficient service.\n\n5.Retail\n\nKey take-aways: optimal stock levels, minimizing costly stockouts or overstock, order processing, seamlessly integration with e-commerce platforms.\n\nChanging consumer preferences, market trends, prices, geopolitics – what is true for retail today can very well be gone tomorrow. Retailers need efficient processes that can adapt swiftly to fluctuations in demand, ensuring optimal stock levels and minimizing costly stockouts or overstock situations. Low-code solutions empower retailers to develop custom applications for inventory tracking, order processing, and supply chain optimization.\n\nAnother critical challenge in retail revolves around the\n\nintegration of e-commerce platforms\n\n. The seamless connection between brick-and-mortar stores and online channels is vital for providing customers with a cohesive shopping experience. Retailers often face complexities in integrating diverse systems, hindering the synchronization of inventory, pricing, and customer data.\n\nLow-code solutions serve as a strategic tool to bridge these gaps by enabling the development of applications that seamlessly integrate e-commerce platforms with in-store operations.This ensures a\n\nunified and consistent experience for customers across all retail channels\n\n.\n\nCustomer relationship management\n\n(CRM) poses another challenge, particularly in tailoring experiences to individual customer needs. Traditional methods may fall short in delivering personalized services and targeted promotions. Low-code applications can be leveraged to create customized CRM solutions that analyse customer data and preferences, facilitating personalized interactions and enhancing customer loyalty.\n\nNear Partner, redefining industries with low-code innovation\n\nBy addressing specific challenges across healthcare, education, government, and retail, low-code can usher in a new era of efficiency, adaptability, and enhanced user experiences.

    "content": "AI seems to be everywhere these days, from plant pollination to predicting\n\nearthworks.\n\nNo wonder the world’s leading\n\nCRM\n\nhas just announced its own revamped AI platform, Salesforce Einstein 1. But look a little closer at some of its features and it is easy to see why Einstein 1 is not just another AI tool. Here is how it can change every aspect of Sales and Marketing in the coming years.\n\nWhat is Salesforce Einstein 1\n\nTechnically speaking, Salesforce Einstein 1 is a unified\n\nAI\n\nplatform for Salesforce’s suite of customer relationship management (CRM) solutions. These are some of\n\nits\n\nkey fe\n\natu\n\nre\n\ns:\n\nEinstein Analytics\n\n:\n\nFilipe Sá\n\n, our Head of Data Analytics, summarizes what he does like this: “Data Analytics is the exploration of all available data, whether or not structured, to extract knowledge and plan actions that generate results.” In a nutshell, this\n\nis what\n\nSalesforce Einstein 1 allows every company to do: it allows businesses to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies much easier and with less human effort.\n\nEinstein Prediction:\n\nthis is one of its most promising features. Salesforce Einstein 1 has predictive capabilities that rely on machine learning, coupled with\n\ndata analytics,\n\nto predict customer and market behaviour, anticipate trends, and identify risks.\n\nEinstein Recommendations:\n\nSalesforce Einstein 1 creates personalised recommendations for products, services, content, or even actions based on previous customer behaviour and preferences.\n\nWhy is Salesforce Einstein 1 such a big deal?\n\nSalesforce Einstein 1\n\nhas a few important advantages for business of all sizes\n\n.\n\nThese are the main ones.\n\n1.\n\nImproved customer service and feedback\n\nwith Einstein 1\n\nDecision-makers can leverage Salesforce Einstein 1 to perform sentiment analysis on customer queries, social media posts, and customer feedback, and to improve customer service by formulating more accurate responses. Not only that, but integrating image recognition into customer-service platforms can assist customer service agents in identifying products or issues via images shared by customers, or even allow customers to search for products or services using images, speeding up the process and enhancing the user experience.\n\nSalesforce Einstein 1 also comes with a few chatbots options: you can use ready-to-use modules or build one from scratch for more personalised assistance. These custom chatbots can be integrated on your website, online store, or even FAQ and support pages. The Einstein bots handle a larger number of inquiries simultaneously, can be integrated into multiple channels, from apps to social media or messaging platforms, and can be programmed to adhere to company policies and brand voice.\n\nHow is Near Partner transforming customer support?\n\nIn our recent Salesforce project, we’ve revolutionized customer interaction by implementing an Enhanced Einstein bot that seamlessly integrates with both our client’s customer portal and WhatsApp support number. This game-changing integration has completely transformed the way customers engage with these channels. Now, instead of waiting for human assistance, customers are greeted by our intelligent bot, which is equipped to handle the most common queries customers typically have.\n\nBut what if the bot can’t address a specific query, or if the customer prefers speaking to a human agent? No problem at all! We’ve got that covered too. Our bot effortlessly transfers the conversation to a live agent who steps in to provide personalized assistance through the Service Console. And here’s the best part – even if there’s no agent available due to high workload or after-hours, our bot doesn’t leave the customer hanging. It proactively offers to create a case for them. If the customer agrees, an automatic case is generated, and the case number is promptly shared with them for future reference.\n\nThis ensures that our clients receive support around the clock, with no query left unanswered. Whether it’s during peak hours or in the dead of night, our customers can rest assured knowing that assistance is always just a message away. It’s all about providing unparalleled support and convenience to our valued clients.\n\n2. Better insights from raw da\n\nta\n\nGenerative AI is not only useful for customer support or business-customer communication. In fact, generative AI makes it easier to translate data analytics, sales and market forecasting and reporting into business insights. Better yet, Salesforce Einstein 1 has the ability to present data in a myriad of ways, such as charts, graphs, tables, and maps, in order to facilitate interpretation and extraction of information that could be difficult to spot in raw data.\n\nSalesforce Einstein 1 goes beyond predictive analytics and dives into prescriptive analytics and recommendations in real-time. For example, it can perform “what-if” analysis to simulate different scenarios and outcomes, and overall evaluate how these would affect the business. Say you would like to see how a change in pricing strategy would affect sales and revenue, or how changes in inventory levels or production schedules could optimize stock levels and minimize overstock or shortages.\n\n3. Improved\n\nsecurity and compliance\n\nIn a world with increasingly smart cyber\n\nsecurity threats\n\n, you may be asking, is all this\n\nsafe to use\n\n? Salesforce went with a “privacy by design” approach for Salesforce Einstein 1, and put a strong focus on security, compliance, and trust, ensuring that businesses can leverage AI responsibly and with confidence.\n\nSalesforce Einstein 1 adheres to advanced encryption techniques to\n\nprotect sensitive customer and business data\n\n, both at rest and in transit. The comprehensive security measures are complemented by strict access controls and audit trails, to safeguard all sensitive or important data, track accesses and modifications, and ensure\n\ndata integrity\n\n.\n\nAnd if you’re worrying about data utility after a long list of compliance measures, don’t. Salesforce Einstein 1 not only complies with a wide range of data privacy regulations, including GDPR, CCPA, and APAC-specific regulations, but also incorporates features for anonymisation and pseudonymisation of data, ensuring both compliance and data utility. Aside from this, the platform undergoes external audits frequently in order to validate its security and compliance posture.\n\nExplainable AI\n\nFurthermore, Salesforce promotes transparency, explainable AI and responsible AI development in the Salesforce Einstein 1 Trust Layer, for increased trust and reliance in AI-driven outcomes. Explainable AI (XAI) refers to the ability of AI systems to provide a rationale for their outcomes, such as business insights in this case. In terms of responsible development, Salesforce has created a dedicated AI Ethics Council that reviews AI products and its ethical impacts on individuals and society, as well as its possible biases. These work together in tandem to ensure transparency and security, fostering trust between the platform and its users.\n\nFind your Salesforce extended team at Near Partner\n\nThe Salesforce ecosystem is vast, dynamic, and continuously empowering for businesses of all sizes. The improved AI platform is just one of the features of Salesforce – albeit a critical one. However, the exponential evolution of AI can be daunting, especially for businesses that lack the in-house expertise to navigate its complexities.\n\nIf you’re seeking to harness the power of Salesforce Einstein 1 to transform the way your business operates, we can help. We have an amazing team of Salesforce experts, ready to help you develop and implement a\n\ncustomized Salesforce AI strategy\n\nthat aligns with your specific business goals.\n\nGet in touch with Near Partner\n\nand let us be part of your Salesforce journey.

    "content": "Why do so many companies outsource their software development? There are a number of reasons:\n\nYour organisation needs specific skills but wants to keep headcount down;\n\nYour business isn’t ready to start or expand an IT department permanently;\n\nYour in-house teams aren’t mature enough in your specific field;\n\nYour organisation needs to\n\nspeed up time-to-market\n\n;\n\nYour internal team is needed for more pressing goals or projects;\n\nYour company simply doesn’t have the manpower for a large project.\n\nAmong many other valid reasons. The solution? A software development team that can work on this project for you with or without the collaboration of your in-house team. At this point, it is worth asking\n\nhow to outsource\n\na development team. The process itself isn’t too complicated but there are some steps you should take.\n\nHow to Outsource: the 9-step guide\n\nGet your notes ready and start planning, these are the 9 steps you should go through:\n\n1. Identify goals, needs, and requirements.\n\nOne of the main reasons software development fails is the lack of clear goals. At this stage, try to be as clear and thorough as possible, and consider:\n\nWhat is it is that my organisation lacks that is stopping us from doing it ourselves? (the answer here may be very direct like time, skills, expertise, numbers, infrastructure, etc. or a combination of these)\n\nWhy does my organisation need this software?\n\nWhat problems will this new software solve?\n\nDoes it matter what technology the outsourcing partner uses?\n\nHow much control do I want my outsourcing partner to have?\n\nHow involved do I want my organisation to be?\n\nThe clearer, the better, for both your organisation and your outsourcing partner. Also, keep in mind that the company’s needs in terms of software development and project requirements need to align with your business goals.\n\n2. Define the scope of the project and end product.\n\nTo understand\n\nhow to outsource\n\nsoftware development, start by defining the project and product – and treat them as two different things. The project scope refers to the work needed to get a finished product, while the product scope refers to all the components, features and functionalities of the end product. A clear scope (project and product) will provide the outsourcing partner with a clear understanding of the\n\nhow\n\nand the\n\nwhat\n\nthat meets your organisation’s expectations. In turn, if your outsourcing partner understands the expectations, the outcomes are much more likely to measure up to your standards.\n\nYour Outsourcing partner will help you through the\n\ndifferent stages\n\nof the project, including to define the scope, overview of the project and budget. Nevertheless, it is important you already have some of this some of these criteria thought up.\n\nIf the project is quite complex or large, or both, your Outsourcing partner might need to create detailed documentation for the first stage of the project (also dubbed a project charter or project initiation documentation).\n\n3. Define your budget.\n\nAnd we mean total budget. You need to consider not only development costs, namely hourly rates, one-time project fees, or other team models, but also additional costs such as investments in project management tools, communication software, and others the team might need to execute the project swiftly. You should also keep a contingency budget in case there are sudden changes to the project or even unforeseen circumstances like, say, a pandemic, changes in industry regulations, or even new laws around privacy, for example.\n\nFor example,\n\nDo you know\n\nhow expensive tech debt is\n\n?\n\nIt\n\nrefers to the cost of having to rework\n\nfaulty or poor-quality software. It is expensive, demotivating, grinding work. It is also, for the most part, avoidable.\n\n4. Define time requirements.\n\nDeadlines are a challenge when it comes to software development projects. Companies easily underestimate how long a project will take, and often times the deadlines need to be adjusted to a more realistic timeframe well into the project. This in turn, affects time-to-market and, of course, the overall budget. Breaking a large project into smaller, iterative chunks, often embraced by methodologies like Agile, helps estimate how long each step will take, define clearer deliverables, and also identify possible bottlenecks earlier in the development cycle.\n\nAt Near Partner, our teams undergo regular\n\nAgile training\n\nto be able to adapt and incorporate the latest changes in the methodology. But is Agile still relevant? Short answer: yes. It is and will continue to be the project management standard for organizations around the world for the foreseeable future. Still, Agile keeps evolving – and we should all be paying attention.\n\nHere’s our view on how to manage projects the right way.\n\n5. Choose an outsourcing model.\n\nFor the project at hand, with the defined budget and deadlines, what outsourcing model fits your organisation best? There\n\nare\n\nseveral\n\nrelationship-based model, such as an\n\nextended team\n\n, dedicated team, project-based, staff augmentation, fixed price, time & materials, and so on. Picking the outsourcing model is a big step on\n\nhow to outsource\n\nright, so be sure to read upon the various models.\n\nAt Near Partner, we believe in healthy, long-term relationships with our clients. This allows us and our clients to evolve and adapt objectives and positioning. Despite the different outsourcing models (for example\n\nNearshore\n\n), we believe that close and flexible collaboration are values that help us achieve better results in line with our clients’ challenges.\n\nWhen looking for a new partner, it’s always beneficial to schedule a call to explore what the outsourcing company stands for. Don’t forget to pay attention to how they communicate, are they clear about where they can help you? Are they transparent about how they work and communicate with their clients?\n\n6. Decide on your tech stack.\n\nDepending on your project and final product you will need different tech stacks, that is, sets of technologies including programming languages, frameworks,\n\nfrontend\n\nand\n\nbackend tools\n\n, databases, testing software, and other support tools.\n\nAlthough there are better-known technologies, be open to different approaches to your problem. Technology evolves at lightning speed, and what you thought was the perfect solution to your challenge may no longer be. Be open to other approaches with different benefits and use cases, but always ask. Your outsourced team is there to help you navigate the endless world of technological possibilities. There are no empty or useless questions.\n\n(And do not forget, when deciding what tech stack to use, you also need to consider short, medium, and long-term maintenance and support costs associated with each choice, and how much you will rely on the outsourced team to maintain the software.)\n\nDo you have a project to develop from scratch and don’t know how to start?\n\nWe can help you understand the different possibilities to your use case.\n\n7. Low-code or traditional development?\n\nYou may be asking,\n\nis low-code for your industry\n\n? If you are looking for the long answer, here’s\n\nDemystifying low code: the e-book\n\n. Low-code and traditional development both achieve the same results, albeit via different routes. Low-code focuses on speed and usability, while traditional development focuses on customisation and control. However, there is also a middle ground between the low-code and the traditional approach: hybrid development. Check out more on the\n\ndifferences between low-code and traditional development\n\n.\n\nAnd if the doubt persists, check\n\nwhat you can build with low-code platforms\n\n.\n\n8. Investigate potential partners.\n\nFinding t\n\nhe right outsourc\n\ning partner is a bit like matchmaking. Except, easier. (Phew!) You need to research your potential partners and\n\ntheir teams\n\n. Specifically, you should look into the team members’ tech stack – individually and as a whole. Are they experts in a particular technology? Is the team diverse in terms of skills? To evaluate a possible outsourcing partner, first, head on to their website; secondly, check their customer reviews and\n\nsuccess stories\n\n, and thirdly, evaluate their portfolio.\n\nIt would be important, as mentioned above, to set up calls and align your company’s values with those of your outsourcing partner, as well as aligning expectations, in addition to all the technical requirements of your project.\n\n9. Choose your best-fit outsourcing partner.\n\nThe most complicated thing about\n\nhow to outsource\n\nis to choose the right partner for your use case. To choose the best partner possible, you must make sure they tick all the above boxes, in terms of pricing, technologies, portfolio, team, work ethics, and so on. However, you should also ensure that both your organisation’s and your partner’s company cultures are compatible. Remember, teams are made of people, and to have the best relation possible between in-house and outsourced teams, there has to be cultural compatibility as well as a certain “chemistry” between them!\n\nCheck\n\nfour more tips\n\non\n\nhow to outsource\n\nefficiently.\n\nFAQs\n\n1. How much does an outsourced team cost?\n\nIt really depends on the project or work you need done, on the team model, and on the type of contract. Assuredly, it will be more affordable than\n\nthe cost of putting together a dream team\n\n.\n\n2. What types of projects can be outsourced?\n\nVirtually any type of project can be outsourced. From databases and networks to final-product web and mobile applications, pretty much anything is a candidate for outsourcing.\n\n3. Is outsourcing a one-and-done deal?\n\nIf you choose so, it can be. However, it isn’t uncommon for companies to maintain long-term business relationship with their outsourcing partners and use them for the majority of their projects. It will depend on the contract you sign with your partner.\n\nLong-term partnerships\n\n4. How can I protect my organisation’s intellectual property?\n\nWhen outsourcing software development, there might be intellectual property involved. These terms are to be defined within the contract you and your partner sign. Normally, if your organisation is to be the sole owner of a software created with the help of an outsourced partner, then the rights and compensation need to be negotiated accordingly.\n\n5. Should I choose an iterative approach like Agile?\n\nAgain, this will depend on the outsourcing partner you choose, on their company culture, and on their way of working. This is why it is so important to familiarise yourself and your organisation with your prospects, in order to make a more informed decision. Check out\n\n8 project management skills\n\nto look for.\n\n6. My organisation deals with sensitive data: how do I go about privacy and confidentiality?\n\nAny good outsourcing company will have a strategy in place to protect their customers’ data. However, this needs to be discussed and not assumed.\n\n7. Can my outsourcing partner train my in-house team?\n\nAbsolutely! This is, again, negotiated during the contract phase, but it should be possible for your partner to train your team, especially if the technology used in the project is a bit out of their comfort zone.\n\nAt Near Partner we believe it is important to transfer knowledge to end users, write user guides, documentation, and provide training. Providing training to clients after the software project is developed is crucial for ensuring its successful utilization. This training serves to familiarize users with the functionalities of the software, teaching them how to navigate it effectively, troubleshoot common issues, and maximize its potential benefits.\n\nBy investing in training sessions, clients can empower their workforce, enhance productivity, and ultimately optimize the return on investment in the software solution. Moreover, comprehensive training fosters a sense of confidence and proficiency among users, which is essential for driving adoption and ensuring long-term success of the software within the organization.",

    "content": "This time last year, few could have predicted the remarkable pace of change we have all witnessed in 2023: huge advancements in generative AI, the metaverse, augmented reality, and so much more. These topics dominated the news, puzzled sceptics, and had business leaders around the world scratching their heads as to what it all meant for\n\ntheir businesses\n\n. For those of us who don’t own a crystal ball, here’s the fun bit: last year may well have been just the appetizer for even bigger things to come. This is what we can probably expect – and how to prepare – in 2024.\n\nCybersecurity & Data Protection\n\nCloud Computing\n\nTech Talent Shortage\n\nEthical AI\n\nGreen Tech & Sustainability\n\nBig\n\nData\n\nRegulatory Compliance\n\nCybersecurity & Data Protection\n\nIBM puts\n\nthe\n\naverage cost of a data breach at 4.45 million USD\n\n– an average from over 500 organisations across 16 countries. Even more shockingly, 82% of breaches involved data stored in the cloud, be it private and/or public.\n\nCyberattacks are expected to become increasingly sophisticated and complex (thanks, AI) and virtually any organisation, regardless of its size, is vulnerable. With cybersecurity being one of the major IT challenges for 2024, it is vital for CEOs to invest in robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard their data and systems, and to stay informed and educated on the new regulations and standards that are emerging globally.\n\nCloud Computing\n\nCloud computing is now an essential part of modern business, enabling companies to scale operations and increase operational efficiency while reducing costs. But there is a catch: around one in every 3 dollars spent in cloud computed ends up “going to waste” –\n\nlikely due t\n\no the fact\n\nthat cloud services are still complex and that most companies lack of expertise and proper training to deal with it. Additionally on the list of cloud challenges for 2024 come compliance and governance, as well as managing multi-cloud. A solid cloud strategy is definitely in the stars for CEOs in the coming year.\n\nTech Talent Shortage\n\nThe\n\nMIT’s Technology Review Insights\n\nreports that 56% of companies complain of an overall shortage of candidates for IT and Tech jobs, while 64% say candidates lack the skills or experience desired. The message is clear: attracting, retaining and upskilling their tech workforce will continue to be a challenge in 2024. Korn Ferry goes a step further and predicts the tech talent shortage to reach 8.5 billion dollars in unrealised annual revenues by 2030. Staying competitive in 2024 means investing in training and development programs to equip employees with the necessary skills for handling emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and blockchain – or in other words, prepare their workforces for the future of work.\n\nEthical AI\n\nBias in AI is not exactly new but it is becoming more and more relevant. As such, an important item in the list of tech challenges for 2024 is to implement governance frameworks for AI systems to ensure organisations operate responsibly and ethically. This also implies that CEOs and IT leaders will have to make important decisions regarding tech infrastructure and train their staf\n\nf in\n\nthe ethical uses of AI.\n\nGreen Tech & Sustainability\n\nThe\n\nIDC forecasts\n\nworldwide spending on purpose-built sustainability services to reach 65 billion dollars by 2027, as the pressure for change grows stronger than ever before. In fact, some publications are calling 2024 “the year of green and sustainable tech”. Far from being limited to renewable energies, this broad trend encompasses everything from more energy-efficient devices, better pollution control systems\n\n,\n\nmore\n\nsustainable data centres and supply chains. At an organisational scale, these challenges for 2024 imply more sustainable practices at both human and technological level.\n\nBig\n\nData\n\nEver heard the phrase: “the problem is not how to get data, the problem is what you do with it”? Turns out, both problems are true. A 2020 report by report from Seagate and IDC found that businesses only used 57% of all the data they collected – and that most companies only stored about half of data within their capabilities. That means only about a fourth of the data generated was actually being used. Later assessments still predict that 40 to 90% of data is unused, depending on the industry. At a first look, it is obvious that one of the biggest challenges for 2024 regarding big data is how organisations manage and analyse it – or rather how they don’t. Sure, AI and ML can help leverage insights from big data. But to truly gain a competitive edge, decision-makers need to look at the bigger picture – from how data is captured to how it stored, managed and accessed.\n\nRegulatory Compliance\n\nThe regulatory landscape surrounding technology is constantly evolving – in just the last few years, the EU alone has seen a sweeping law for online privacy take effect, associated with concerns about data privacy, anti-competitive practices, and the overall impact of technology on society. At this point, companies of all sizes feel prompted to address these concerns and demonstrate responsible data stewardship practices. Training programs, clear compliance policies and procedures, and holding employees accountable for their compliance responsibilities will be key in 2024 and the coming years to stay compliant.\n\nFacing the IT & tech challenges for 2024 with a reliable partner\n\nMany of the IT and tech challenges for 2024 involve reconciling the conflicting needs of various departments and teams, such as balancing innovation and risk, aligning investments with business goals, breaking siloed operations of different departments, and fostering collaboration, and ensuring a smooth adaptation to recent technologies while protecting ethical and responsible development. An experienced partner can play a pivotal role in helping businesses navigate these complex technology challenges and get on track to achieve business goals.\n\nGet in touch with Near Partner\n\nand let’s navigate the challenges for 2024 together.",

    "content": "Diversity in the workplace has been a hot topic in recent years, but it is far more than a buzzword. It benefits employees, employers, and the society we live in. This is what it means to us.\n\nWhat even is diversity in the workplace?\n\nThe benefits of diversity in the workplace\n\nHow to foster diversity in the workplace?\n\nWhat even is diversity in the workplace?\n\nDiversity in the workplace means having a workforce with different skills, backgrounds, and experiences. Otherwise, it refers to providing every individual equal opportunity, rights, and resources, regardless of gender, age, or background.\n\nA while ago, I lead a conversation (which we call Near Talk) about Multiculturalism, in which we tried to explore together the meaning of diversity and multiculturalism at Near Partner. As an IT recruiter, I consider this to be one of the most complex but fundamental topics to ponder when working in a collaborative environment.\n\nAccording to Catarina, our Accounting and Finance Manager, diversity “is what makes us stronger, what makes us think differently”. I asked one of Near Partner’s developers, Christopher, how he would define multiculturalism: “Multiculturalism is the practical coexistence of different cultures, ethnicities, and beliefs in which all are accepted and respected.” Ricardo Cotilho, on the other hand, thinks that multiculturalism should be “more than a ‘passive’ acceptance”; in his mind, multiculturalism should be “the existence of an environment or society where all people from different backgrounds feel that they are part of common equality and not a segregated minority”.\n\nThere are different dimensions of diversity in the workplace, which can be internal (the inner, immutable characteristics of an individual), external (situational or circumstantial characteristics), or even organizational (relating to an individual’s position, affiliation, or background within an organization).\n\nBelow are some of the many dimensions of diversity in the workplace here at Near Partner:\n\nGender and sex\n\nSexual orientation\n\nEthnicity, race, and nationality\n\nReligion and spirituality\n\nAge\n\nPhysical and mental abilities\n\nEducational, cultural and socio-economic background\n\nLanguage\n\nPolitical beliefs\n\nThe benefits of diversity in the workplace\n\nHow does an organization and its people benefit from diversity in the workplace?\n\nStronger company culture\n\nCompany culture is the set of principles and values by which a company and its people guide themselves in relation to work. With more diversity in the workplace, the company culture becomes more inclusive, broader, and more complete, ensuring no one is excluded, and all the people contribute to it.\n\nPositive employer/brand reputation\n\nEmployers who treat their employees fairly, and equitably, and show tolerance to different backgrounds, are often perceived as brands that value inclusivity, equality, and social responsibility. These are all positive characteristics that resonate with customers, employees, and stakeholders alike.\n\nDeeper understanding of customers\n\nHaving diversity in the workplace can be very helpful in dealing with diverse customers. People with specific experiences and backgrounds connect on a deeper level with customers with similar experiences and backgrounds.\n\nMore creativity, productivity, and innovation\n\nIdeas aren’t created out of thin air, rather, ideas and inspiration are a result of one’s own mind, but also one’s experiences. A diverse workforce will inspire innovation by adding different perspectives to the mix, often\n\nleading to “outside of the box” solutions\n\nto problems.\n\nIncreased employee engagement\n\nDiversity in the workplace means creating a welcoming environment for all identities, which will allow people to identify and feel a sense of belonging in the organization. A\n\n2015 study published in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology\n\nfound that inclusion and diversity in the workplace lead to more trust in the employer, thus increasing engagement.\n\nIncreased returns\n\nAccording to\n\nMcKinsey’s 2015\n\nDiversity Matters\n\nstudy\n\n– performed with data from 366 managers in Canada, Latin America, the UK, and the US  – companies in the top quartile for racial, ethnic and gender diversity are more likely to generate larger financial returns. The study also suggests that diversity in the workplace seems to be correlated with better performance.\n\nHow to foster diversity in the workplace?\n\nFor us at Near Partner, fostering diversity in the workplace is a continuous effort. Here are some ways to make your organization a more inclusive, diverse, and equitable place:\n\nBe aware of bias\n\nWhether we fight it or not, it’s impossible to be completely unbiased. Everything in our lives causes us to have some kind of bias, conscious or unconscious. One thing that is possible, though, is to be aware that these biases exist and try to root them out. Acknowledging bias is the first step to a more diverse workplace.\n\nPromote pay equity\n\nEspecially in larger organizations, it is quite easy to miss some pay gaps, patterns, or trends within departments, that may be hurting some groups of the workforce.\n\nOffer diversity and sensitivity training\n\nIt is not uncommon for people who benefit from some sort of privilege – whatever that may be – to be effectively blind to others’ struggles. Diversity and sensitivity training can help increase awareness and understanding of diversity issues in the workplace, helping also to avoid clashes, misunderstandings, and discrimination.\n\nReview company policies\n\nMany of the policies in your organization may not be as inclusive as you thought. And to truly have diversity in the workplace, you may need to review, amend, or even create new ones, from recruitment to performance evaluations. Some areas to think about are on-site daycare, flexible working hours, inclusive facilities, language barriers, and religious/cultural holidays.\n\nDiversity in the workplace at Near Partner\n\nEvery day, we try to make Near Partner an inclusive, fair, equitable and diverse workplace where our people feel like they belong, and where they feel happy and proud.

These 2\n\nsuccess stories\n\nfrom our customers showcase how this new approach to software development is quickly becoming the driving force behind seriously disruptive solutions.\n\nIn short,\n\nlow-code\n\nenables developers to build applications using visual interfaces and pre-built components, rather than writing extensive code by hand. It reduces development time, increases productivity, and allows individuals with little programming experience to participate in the software development process. Simply put, OutSystems is where you got to create apps at the speed of light using low-code. It provides a visual and intuitive environment to create, deploy, and manage applications more efficiently.\n\nHere are a few inspiring low-code stories of brands that are already using low-code every day.\n\nTransforming Business Operations with low-code\n\n1. The Standard\n\nThe Standard\n\n, an insurance company based in Portland, faced several challenges in financial request management, including manual processes, complex workflows, limited technology adoption, security concerns, scalability issues, and regulatory compliance challenges. These obstacles hindered the company’s efficiency, resulting in potential delays and security risks.\n\nThe Standard partnered with Near Partner, which presented a comprehensive application based on Business Process Technology (BPT). This solution aimed to automate processes, enhance workflow efficiency, reduce approval time, and ensure secure access. We successfully addressed challenges like complex workflow design, integration with Active Directory, data interpretation, user interface complexity, and legal compliance, resulting in transformative benefits for The Standard.\n\nThe implemented solution led to significant improvements, including automation and efficiency gains, improved workflows, enhanced control and security, a user-friendly interface, strategic recognition in the industry, cost and time savings, and adaptability for future development. Preliminary results indicated substantial time savings in request processing, contributing to increased productivity and potential cost savings for The Standard.\n\n2. Asseco\n\nAsseco\n\nfaced the challenge of outdated legacy applications that hindered their ability to adapt to evolving business requirements. They needed a scalable and agile solution that could accommodate the diverse needs of over 400 users spread across 8 different countries. The legacy applications lacked the flexibility and responsiveness needed for seamless business operations, especially in areas such as internal expenses, travel expenses, financial project management, and integration with SAP.\n\nThe intuitive visual development environment facilitated quick iterations, ensuring adaptability to the organization’s dynamic needs. The implementation of a travel expenses app streamlined and automated the expense reporting process, enhancing efficiency and accuracy for employees across different countries. Additionally, OutSystems empowered Asseco to build a comprehensive financial project management application, simplifying project tracking and providing real-time financial insights for improved decision-making. The seamless integration with SAP ensured data consistency and coherence across the organization, eliminating departmental silos and optimizing workflows. Beyond functionality, OutSystems allowed for a revamped user experience, contributing to improved user satisfaction and a more cohesive and professional brand image.\n\nBook your place today\n\nat Jump Start and understand how low-code can accelerate your business.\n\nIf you still have doubts about how low-code can potentially help your company,\n\ndownlod our eBook\n\nDemystifying Low-Code.",

    "content": "an it really speed up enterprise-grade development?\n\nMarcelo Ferreira, the Head of Low Code at Near Partner, shares his take.\n\nMeet Marcelo Ferreira. An experienced\n\nOutSystems developer\n\n, and a mentor here at Near Partner, Marcelo Ferreira has been involved with low-code for several years. Now, he shares his unique knowledge after many projects, and explains how to create an excellent application at lightning speed.\n\nOutSystems creates mission-critical applications and updates them quickly. It’s a state-of-the-art visual tool to speed up development, while AI-based automation throughout the SDLC ensures updates in hours, not weeks. Quickly and securely scalables applications for more than 100 million users in a modern, cloud-native architecture.\n\nWhy low code?\n\nLow code is a growing force nowadays, and while there are many ways low code can improve a business’ performance, it is always best to listen to the pros. We asked Marcelo why he made the\n\nswitch from traditional development\n\n– in which he has his academic background and years of experience – to low code development.\n\n“Look, the world is changing at a very quick pace. High code languages are no longer the right answer for every use case – as they can’t keep up with the rapid rate the world’s changing.”\n\n“What attracts me most in low code is not having to do those repetitive tasks every project needs, over and over. With low code, those necessary parts are already wrapped in pre-built building blocks that can be used and adapted easily.”\n\nThis way, he adds,\n\n“I can free up my time to focus on the problem-solving part of my work and deliver maximum value for my clients.”\n\nMarcelo vividly recalls how a former client of his team was dealing with manual processes and falling behind because of it.\n\n“In just a few months we were able to digitise their entire business with low code.” Similarly, another big tech client chose Outsystems for their framework: “Redoing all the applications with recent technology would take over a decade; with low-code we were able to redo and improve them in only one year.”\n\nHow do you work and guide your team through challenges?\n\nBeing Head of Low Code at Near Partner means Marcelo is responsible for the low code team – the same team he helped put together.\n\n“My job is to nurture my team, help them develop into the best skilled professionals they can be.”\n\nMarcelo achieves this not only by mentoring individual developers, but also by finding the right projects.\n\n“I try to find and assign interesting projects to every one of them, projects that are a challenge and can help them tap into their potential.”\n\nHowever, there are always obstacles along the way.\n\n“It may seem contradictory”\n\n, he adds, “but a project that moves too fast can overload the client’s in-house team. When this happens, teamwork between us at Near Partner and them is essential.” In such cases, it is paramount to manage expectations and have a share a common purpose.\n\n“For us at Near Partner, the most important of all is the connection with our clients. We want to speak the same language, share the same culture, be on the same page. We understand their business and their success is our success.”\n\nAlso part of our Low-Code team is an\n\nOutSystems Champion\n\n, Nelson André. He’s been with Near Partner since 2018 and, during that time, he’s improved as a programmer and contributed to a fantastic workplace. We can say that, like the OutSystems community, Nelson has learnt a lot and given a lot in return. If you are not familiar with the\n\nOutSystems Champions Program\n\n, it essentially\n\nidentifies, recognises, and rewards community leaders.\n\nThe program provides a framework for collaboration between community enthusiasts and OutSystems teams. Champions are there to guide and help the whole OutSystems community.\n\nIs low-code really for everyone?\n\nLow-code was always meant for “citizen developers”, meaning everyone should be able to partake. But is it really so?\n\n“All the low code platforms we work with have learning paths available that any beginner can absolutely follow. The best part, though, are the communities!”\n\nHe adds “It is easy to learn the technology with so much support from the communities – any doubt you may have will for sure be answered in the forums and\n\ndedicated learning channels.”\n\n“If I could go back in my low code journey, one thing I would do differently is I would have started interacting and learning from the Outsystems community much earlier. It took me a while, but I figured it out: cooperation, collaboration, no man left behind… that is low code!”\n\nAbout Marcelo\n\nMarcelo is an OutSystems Most Valuable Professionals, that is, a valuable member of the Outsystems community, recognised for his outstanding contributions to the platform and ecosystem. A MVP is an individual whose technical expertise has impacted the community for the better via the creation of Forge components, additions to Outsystems documentation, and designing new functionalities and improvements for Outsystems products. OuSystems recognizes these valuable experts and introduces them to the OutSystems ecosystem of partners and customers as the best developers on the market.\n\n“It is truly an honour to be a part of the MVP programme. The most rewarding is to see Outsystems grow, in part due to my support and contributions.”\n\nHowever, Marcelo feels the Outsystems’ community also gives back to him.\n\n”When I see that the functionalities I helped create and design are working properly I feel I get back as much as I give. I am\n\nalso a user of those very same functionalities.”\n\nTake the plunge: request your\n\nFree Consultation\n\nand dive into the possibilities of low-code.",

    "content": "This concept was explained very recently by Paul Graham.\n\nThere is a particularly important concept which is very seldom talked about. However, understanding it is hugely correlated with our success, whether professionally, personally, as individuals or as companies and organizations – it is the idea of\n\nSuperlinear Returns\n\n.\n\nI will define what superlinear returns are in a minute, but, beforehand, it is important to know that,\n\nalthough the concept is easy to understand it is not intuitive to put into practice\n\nbecause we were led to believe that the world works exactly the other way around. Given that, I will ask for your patience to indulge me with an explanation.\n\nBut what are superlinear returns and how does it compare to linear returns?\n\nWe are led to believe that, regarding most of the things in the world, what you get is proportional to what you put in. Let us call to what you put in “effort.” It might be time spent, hard work, dedication, or any other use of energy.\n\nSo, what you come to believe, when you are a child, is that if you participate in all the training practices, you will eventually be selected for the first team. Or that if you apply some effort during classes, you will learn something. But, if you try a little bit harder, you will learn a little bit more. These are examples of linear returns. And although these are not explicitly stated like this, it has been made implicit that this is how it works.\n\nThis is not true. As life goes on you come to realize that most of the time, if you are almost as good as the kid you are playing against, you will almost always lose! At least in sports, most of the time, the winner takes it all.  I would say that is usually the first experience when we understand that returns are not linear.\n\nA universal experience of superlinear return\n\nMost of us were exposed to the most ubiquitous experience of superlinear returns. I am talking about learning. Learning is one of those cases where how much you learn is directly related to how much you have learned so far. This seems like a remarkably simple proposition, but what it means is that learning grows exponentially. Just think about it for a moment. It is startling! But we go through it without explicitly understanding it.\n\nEverybody gets surprised by the story of the pastor who won a chess match against his king and asked for a chessboard of grains of rice placed upon each square such that one grain was placed on the first square, two on the second, four on the third, and so on (doubling the number of grains on each subsequent square).\n\nThe result amounts to more than 18 quintillion grains of rice (more than 18 million of millions of millions or more than 18.4 x\n\n10\n\n18\n\n).\n\nGoing back to learning, the example is easy to understand. You go to primary school and learn the numbers. That is simple, but learning the numbers allows you to count, and measure. Pretty cool. But then you can learn to sum, subtract, and multiply. And from there you can learn everything algebra gives. And because of that, you can learn physics. Or complicated mathematical operations. And so, how much you have already learned compounds to the new fields you can now learn.\n\nBut there is more. There are the practical uses of what you learned and how that allows you to learn more. To begin with, the more you learn, the more the teachers will push you to learn and so… the more you have learned so far, the more you will learn. Also, how much you have already learned will allow you to move into better schools, with better teachers and the machine will keep working like this. On and on.\n\nLearning compounds. Like the interest rates of an investment.\n\nThis has been, since ancient times, one of the biggest causes of inequality. That is why people still talk about the social elevator being powered through education. It is because of how much further away one finds himself if he is “caught” on this compounding machine of learning.\n\nIn business you may find that if you are selling lemonade, and your lemons are a little bit better than those of all the competition, you will have an advantage which is not proportional to how much better your lemons are. You will be able to sell all your lemonade at a higher price than all the competition.\n\nThis means we can summarize the situations as Linear and Superlinear Returns. And the Superlinear Returns will, most of the time, be in an exponential (like learning) or in a threshold (like the lemonade example) situation.\n\nSo far so good.\n\nBut why is this important? Is this just theoretical? No, it is not.\n\nTo begin with, because by understanding the concept you can use it in your favor and improve your odds. It becomes clear that “learning machines” will have an edge and will always win. This is because if you can learn at a greater rate, you will know more (exponentially more) than your peers. But as companies and organizations it is also important to understand how you can beat the competition.\n\nThe landscape is not linear. Success is not linear.\n\nAs\n\nPaul Graham\n\nputs it, if you do exceptional work, you will probably crush it!\n\nOn the one hand there is much less competition there, as we saw above, if you pushed yourself (individually or as a company) ahead of the crowd, you will be exponentially more knowledgeable. Most people will be afraid to even get a shot at excellence, so you will find a very solitary playground, just for you.\n\nA few weeks ago, we\n\npublished a post with some of the\n\nchallenges\n\nwe have identified for 2024. The ones who will be better able to tackle these will have to stack superlinear returns in their favor.\n\nA philosophical reflection on superlinear returns\n\nPhilosophically, there is another reason why the concept is important. As we live in an age of despair, the superlinear returns concept is important to understand, because it gives you a clearer view of the World. When we look into the news, we come with a depressing idea that the World is going bonkers, and that humanity as such is probably doomed. As the author\n\nSteve Pinker\n\nputs it the World is “bad but better”.”\n\nIn his multi-awarded book\n\n“Sapiens,” Harari\n\nremembered us that for the first time in the world: there are more people dying from self-inflicted wounds than from being murdered (including in wars); there are more people suffering from obesity than from malnutrition in the world; there are more people dying today from old age diseases than infectious diseases.\n\nThe reality is that much of the improvement that we can detect (although sometimes we do not feel it) is based on a superlinear return. For instance, world health has been improving for a few centuries now. But the fact is that the rate of improvement has been accelerating. Although how and why goes beyond the topic of this article, it would be important to understand it if we are making global decisions about where and when to invest. As electors we are often being called to voice our opinion about these matters.\n\nFor all the reasons above, I think this concept to be mind-blowing. The thing is, if you are like me, you understood the concept a long time ago, but\n\nit is challenging making it explicit. However, it must be clear for one to build on it.\n\nWe need it clearly stated, before we can begin to use it. In our everyday life; in our professional work; in our companies; and as citizens.\n\n– “If you’re not learning, you’re probably not on a path that leads to superlinear returns”, Paul Graham;\n\nNever miss a beat!

    "content": "Near Partner has been offering insights and expertise in topics ranging from Salesforce, OutSystems and Software Development to Project Management and Business Digital Strategy. Let’s revisit the top 6 articles that resonated the most with our audience, offering valuable insights for businesses navigating the digital ecosystem.\n\nHappy new year? 7 key challenges for 2024\n\nThis time last year, few could have predicted the remarkable pace of change we have all witnessed in 2023: huge advancements in generative AI, the metaverse, augmented reality, and so much more. These topics dominated the news, puzzled sceptics, and had business leaders around the world scratching their heads as to what it all meant for their businesses. For those of us who don’t own a crystal ball, here’s the fun bit: last year may well have been just the appetizer for even bigger things to come. This is what we can probably expect – and how to prepare – in 2024.\n\nBuilding blocks of innovation: what is modular architecture\n\nEver since Henry Ford built the first Model T in 1913, managers, consultants, researchers and workers have been looking for ways of replicating that same logic elsewhere. Over 100 years later, coders are turning vision to reality, by reinterpreting the assembly line concept to their unique programming needs. The result is a leaner approach to IT projects, with shorter lead times and less tech debt. This is what modular architecture actually means for projects and why it matters.\n\nWhat is Salesforce LWR?\n\nVibrant digital communities, self-service knowledge bases, engaging web portals with vital data and KPIs. These are just some of the broad applications of the new Salesforce Lightning Web Runtime (LWR). The long-awaited improvement on Experience Cloud is finally here and it features significant performance improvements, especially for large-scale applications, while maintaining high security standards and intuitive interface. This is what it means and why it could be a gamechanger.\n\nOutSystems: 8 features you may not be aware of\n\nOutSystems is a giant that keeps on growing, inviting everyone to embrace digital transformation. Reactive web applications, AI-assisted development, voice commands and progressive web apps are just some of the eye-popping OutSystems’ features that meet the development imperatives for success in the digital age. So, grab a seat and get ready to be amazed.\n\nIn our latest ebook, we’ve broken down the complexities and myths surrounding low-code, revealing the true potential it holds for revolutionizing the way we build and deploy applications.\n\nDownload here.\n\nMuleSoft: what is and why it matters\n\nIn 2021, organizations worldwide were using\n\nover 100 software as a service (SaaS) applications\n\n– over 6 times the number of apps just 2 years before. With a simple interface, MuleSoft connects different sources to transform chaotic streams of data into useful, actionable insights and a single source of truth. Get to know this software platform and how it may become your data analysts’ new best friend.\n\nManaging Projects: our view on how to do it right\n\nProject management, or the process of managing projects, can take many paths; it all depends on what type of projects you manage, what kind of business you’re in, and the background of those involved. It is always complex, no matter what the scale or scope. Managing projects is such a challenge that despite decades of methodologies, advice and books,\n\naround 75% IT projects keep failing\n\n. Reasons range from a poorly defined scope to inadequate vision or excess complexity. There is a lot that can go wrong and it takes a very special person to keep it on the right track – the Project Manager.\n\nHere’s to another year of digital empowerment! ?",

    "content": "The JavaScript ecosystem is buzzing with exciting new features.\n\nCheck out the hottest JavaScript trends right now.\n\nJavaScript is the world’s most used programming language. In 2022,\n\n17.4 million software developers\n\n(of nearly 30 million) used JavaScript around the world. It is used as client-side programming language in\n\nover 98% of websites globally\n\n, and there are 1.4 million JavaScript libraries available.\n\nCreated in 1995 by Mozilla co-founder Brendan Eich, JavaScript was influenced by older programming languages such as Self, Python, Java, Scheme or C. Its influenced is felt even on recent languages such as ActionScript, TypeScript, JS++, Dart or Jscript. There are also dozens of JavaScript frameworks in use today.\n\nMost popular web frameworks (2023, from >67k respondants). Source:\n\nStackOverflow.\n\nAs more and more features are added and released, JavaScript and JavaScript-based frameworks keep evolving – becoming more functional, flexible – and more demanded by employers all over the world. It’s obvious JavaScript isn’t going anywhere but forward, so we’ve put together a list of trends going strong this year. Check out the hottest JavaScript trends right now.\n\n10 JavaScript trends to watch for\n\nThe JavaScript ecosystem moves fast, with cool new features popping up everywhere. But beyond the “next-big-thing” run some deeper trends worth watching out for.\n\n1. TypeScript is catching up!\n\nIt may sound weird that one of the JavaScript trends is the rise in popularity of another language, but if you look closely, you’ll understand why. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript (meaning it contains all the features of JavaScript and expands it with additional features). While JavaScript is still the “king of web”, TypeScript has risen in popularity over the last years, going\n\nfrom 12% usage in 2017 to 34% in 2022\n\n. While JavaScript is used to build interactive web pages, in conjunction with HTML and CSS, TypeScript is more focused on large-scale web apps.\n\n2. Parallax Websites going mainstream\n\nIn computer graphics, parallax refers to a technique where multiple layers move at different rates while scrolling up and down the page, creating an interesting visual effect or optical illusion that adds movement and three-dimensional depth. While this is not new – Super Mario Bros mastered parallax in the 80’s – the ever-demanding world of web design is now making parallax websites a JavaScript trend for this year and more to come.\n\n3. Single-Page Applications\n\nA single-page app (SPA) is an application that loads only one single page and rewrites the page content from a web server as the user interacts with it, instead of reloading a new page for each interaction. A SPA renders JavaScript directly in the browser, making it an interesting option for businesses, because of its simpler structure, easy navigation, and use of fewer resources.\n\nSource:\n\nOutSystems\n\nFrom a technical point of view, SPAs are easier and cheaper to develop since they use repetitive layouts. SPAs are also more mobile-friendly than typical websites. Do we need to say more? So, yes, expect SPAs as a major JavaScript trend.\n\n4. Progressive Web Applications\n\nProgressive Web Apps (PWA) are a recent type of web apps that blend the best of web and native app development. PWAs can be installed and used in the same way that native apps do, while being lighter and operating offline with cached data. The point of PWAs – mostly written in JavaScript – is to enrich user experiences, just like SPAs. PWAs are accessible from any device, from smartphones, to tablets and desktop computers, which makes them not only a JavaScript trend but also a web development trend.\n\n5. The return of Server-Side Rendering\n\nNext on JavaScript trend-list: server-side rendering (SSR). SSR is the ability of a website to load completely on the server and be presented as a static HTML on the client side, as opposed to Client-side rendering (CSR) which means the webpage is rendered entirely on the browser with JavaScript. SSR lost popularity to CSR in the mid-2010s, with the rise of SPAs.\n\nSSR vs CSR. Source:\n\nGrowthRocket.\n\nHowever, SSR is making a comeback, especially because of SEO, since SSR allows Googlebot to consider the content of the page faster and HTML content is not empty. So, while the most popular JavaScript frameworks default to CSR, we are seeing an uptake in JavaScript server-side rendering.\n\n6. D\n\nark Mode in JavaScript\n\nDark Mode has gained a lot of traction over the last decade, and it’s recently become a JavaScript trend. The main reasons for implementing dark mode are minimizing device energy consumption, reducing eye strain, and – let’s be real here – aesthetic purposes. Some UI design just looks really sleek in dark mode. Whatever the reason, dark mode is a must nowadays, and there are a number of ways to achieve it. There are a couple of libraries such as Darkmode.js or Nightly.js that can do the trick, but everyday developers all over the world come up with smarter, more creative ways of doing it.\n\n7. Svelte on the rise\n\nSvelte is a library-turned-framework, just like React and Vue. Despite being a relative newcomer to the JavaScript world, Svelte is quickly becoming an attractive JavaScript staple because of the way it works. Just like React or Vue, Svelte allows devs to build fast, lean, interactive web apps; however, Svelte converts the code into pure JavaScript at build time, instead of interpreting the code at runtime. For this reason, Svelte is also called a compiler. Additionally, Svelte was designed to work on low-power and low-capacity devices.\n\n8. Webpack still leading\n\nWebpack is a\n\nmodule bundler\n\nfor JavaScript apps that runs on Node.js. It is a development tool that packages many JavaScript modules into a bundle and serves it to the browser. Webpack is great because it transforms front-end assets such as HTML, CSS, and images into a format that is convenient for the browser, keeping everything neat and tidy and, thanks to a dependency graph, error-free. The popularity of webpack isn’t new – it has consistently been the preferred module bundler for JavaScript since its launch in 2014. The trend is that it will probably maintain its status\n\nfor years to come\n\n.\n\n9. More JavaScript Runtimes\n\nNode.js has been the default choice for a JavaScript runtime since… forever? But other runtimes are stepping up. New names like\n\nDeno\n\nand\n\nBun\n\nare making some noise. Deno gets brownie points for first-class TypeScript support, while Node.js needs to transpile TypeScript to JavaScript. Note that Node.js and Deno were created by the very same person, Ryan Dahl, 10 years apart. Bun, on the other hand, promises “three to four times faster runtimes” than Node.js or Deno. But there are more, namely some JavaScript embeddable runtimes like Duktape, Elk, and Espruino.\n\n10. JavaScript Meta-Frameworks boom\n\nMeta frameworks are\n\nweb development frameworks\n\nthat are built upon one or more frameworks. React, for example, is a JavaScript framework with a meta-framework called Next.js. There’s also Nuxt.js (Vue, Node), analogjs (Angular), SolidStart (SolidJS), SvelteKit (Svelte), Astro (React, Vue, Svelte), Remix, Qwik… You get the gist. Well, an undeniable JavaScript trend for this year (and we are sure for many to come) is the absolute explosion of JavaScript meta-frameworks. While it can get a tad overwhelming with so many meta-frameworks to choose from, it is also great; having more options means you get to be as picky as your project requires. We are actually very curious about what new meta-frameworks are coming and what exciting features they bring to the table.\n\nOutsourcing JavaScript developers with Near Partner\n\nHave these JavaScript trends opened your appetite for a new JavaScript project? Same! We are excited with all the new possibilities in the JavaScript ecosystem and think you should be too.\n\nGet the right JavaScript developers to create a dynamic and engaging web application, an innovative project, or to improve and enhance the customer experience of your existing solution.

This is how we make it happen.\n\nProject management, or the process of\n\nmanaging projects\n\n, can take many paths; it all depends on what type of projects you manage, what kind of business\n\nyou’re\n\nin, and the background of those involved. It is always complex, no matter what the scale or scope.\n\nManaging projects is such a challenge that despite\n\ndecades of\n\nmethodologies,\n\nadvice\n\nand books,\n\naround 75% IT projects keep failing\n\n. Reasons range from a poorly defined scope to inadequate vision or excess complexity.\n\nThere is a lot that can go\n\nwrong\n\nand it takes\n\na very special\n\nperson to keep it on the right track – the\n\nProject Manager\n\n.\n\nSource:\n\nProofHub\n\nCheck out the 8 IT project\n\nmanagement skills\n\nyou need to succeed.\n\nA Project Manager needs a lot more than time management and people skills. A Project Manager is like a maestro, coordinating musicians playing various instruments, each with a specific purpose. Although there isn’t a specific formula, there are more some important guidelines to managing projects, especially in the Tech space. Let’s dig in!\n\nManaging projects\n\nefficiently: our guide\n\nA Project Manager is both a facilitator and communicator, ensuring everyone shares the same vision. But how can do Near Partner’s Project Managers juggle the demands of customers, team members, and different departments, while keeping the project development on the right track? We usually divide projects into 5 different and specific phases, which, all together, enable reaching success and client satisfaction.\n\nFrom the PMP preparation guide, here’s what’s included in each phase and how we manage a project at Near Partner:\n\n5 stages of a Project\n\nStage 1: Project Initiation\n\nThe first stage of managing projects is the project initiation, or conception. In this initial phase, the Project Manager defines, with all main stakeholders, the actual scope, with a detailed analysis of all the variables involved. In short, this phase is the project foundation, where the following need to be considered:\n\nScope of the project:\n\nmeaning limits and boundaries, and objectives or goals.\n\nOverview:\n\nthe overview considers the resources, the time limits, and the goals required to complete a project, including the KPIs to measure them.\n\nBudget\n\ns\n\n:\n\nbudgeting is also included in this initial stage and should accommodate possible changes or problems within a reasonable margin.\n\nIf the project is quite complex or large, or both, we might need to create detailed documentation for this stage (also dubbed a project charter or project initiation documentation).\n\nStage 2: Project Planning\n\nOnce the project clears the initiation stage, there comes the planning stage. The project plan consists of:\n\nSelection of team members\n\nResource estimation\n\nPrediction of dependencies\n\nOutline of deliverables\n\nCreation of roadmap\n\nCreation of a product backlog\n\nPlanning of dates and milestones\n\nAlso in the planning stage, the Project Manager will choose and outline which project management method to follow, such as Waterfall, Scrum, Kanban, Lean, among others – but we’ll expand more on those later.\n\nNow we are ready for a kick-off meeting!\n\nStage 3: Project Execution\n\nConception and planning are done, so it is time to execute. This execution phase usually starts with a meeting where team members are informed of their roles and responsibilities. The project execution is about getting things done, following (or adapting) the plan and meeting deadlines.\n\nDuring the execution phase, the Project Manager is quite busy, managing all aspects of the project, such as workflows, changes, and corrective actions. This stage relies immensely on communication among team members, between different teams and departments, and also between all of the above and the Project Manager. Communication is one of our main skills and something we try to exercise like a muscle.\n\nCheck out our project management dream combination\n\ntoolkit\n\n.\n\nStage 4: Project Monitoring and Controlling\n\nThe monitoring and control stage happens simultaneously with the execution. This stage focuses on performance, progression, status, budget, and schedule. More concretely, the Project Manager must be able to answer questions like “where are we in the project?”, “where should we be in the project, according to the roadmap?”, “how much is still to be done?”, “what are the issues encountered and why?”, “will we be able to meet X deadline?”, and “will the project be finished on time?”, among a myriad of others.\n\nThis monitoring can be done in many ways such as via regular project “check-ins” with teams or use of tracking tools and frameworks (Kanban boards for example, team stand-ups, etc). Essentially, we must be on top of key activities and take action should some problem arise. It also should be noted that communication and teamwork are key in this stage.\n\nStage 5: Project Closure\n\nThe final stage of the project management lifecycle is its Closure – also known as lessons learned or postmortem – and can be done through a\n\nretrospective\n\n. Here, the Project Manager must assess, with the team and main stakeholders, performance, what went well and what could have been done better, maintaining important records, templates and documentation. Last but not least, celebrating the success of the project.\n\nIncluded in the Project Closure is the “project delivery”, that means all activities are wrapped up and the final product is delivered. The Project Manager presents this document to a client, an internal team or department, or an external stakeholder.\n\nDepending on the project and on the project management style, there might be the need for concluding any formal contracts or agreements, as well as for conducting a final audit of the project.\n\nThis is how we carried out a project that filled a technological gap within\n\nQMC\n\nand brought about a cultural change.\n\nProject Management methodologies\n\nAside from the five stages of project management, there are several project management styles or methodologies. These are ways of organizing project development cycle using certain sets of principles, guidelines, tools, or communication channels, that meet the client’s requirements.\n\nSome of the most popular project management methodologies that we are fans of:\n\nAgile\n\nIf you have been following us for a while, you know\n\nwe use Agile quite often.\n\nIt is a\n\nflexible and people-centred\n\napproach to project management. It is usually deployed in software development, using an\n\niterative style\n\n. Projects benefit from an Agile methodology when they require the client to take an active part in the development, when the scope is not well defined and to adapt to changes more easily.\n\nThere are several practices that fall under the Agile methodology, such as Scrum, Kanban, Lean, and XP.\n\nScrum:\n\nsuited for fast-paced and independent team-driven projects\n\nKanban:\n\nfor transparent and highly organised workload-driven projects (ex. manutention projects)\n\nExtreme Programming (XP\n\n):\n\nfor productivity-driven projects requiring fast and continuous workflow.\n\nLean:\n\nfor resource-driven projects\n\nWaterfall\n\nThe Waterfall methodology can be seen as the opposite of Agile. The Waterfall is the traditional project management technique that is characterised by its\n\nlinear and sequential\n\nnature. It is\n\nplan-driven,\n\nas opposed to Agile’s change-drive, and is most beneficial for small projects with\n\nextensive documentation (requirements definition)\n\n. In the Waterfall method, quality is prioritised over speed.\n\nCritical Path Method (CPM)\n\nThe CPM is\n\ndetailed and dependency-oriented\n\n, for\n\ntime-driven\n\nprojects, that are complicated and have many\n\nmutually dependent elements\n\n. In essence, the CPM can be compared to the Waterfall, with the difference that this method recognises dependencies. A dependency is a task that must be completed before another task can move forward, thus creating a critical path.\n\nThe main objective of CPM is to find the path having the biggest duration, and then the most critical, as if a step of this process gets delayed, it will delay the main delivery date. I wouldn’t say it’s a methodology but a tool or a step in a project, principally in project planning.\n\nCritical Chain Project Management (CCPM)\n\nThe CCPM is an alternative to the CPM, as it focuses not on time but on the resources (human, hardware, equipment, etc) available for the project. This means that under the CCPM method, the focus is on\n\ncritical tasks\n\n, there is no multitasking, and the time allocated to each project stage is estimated based on\n\n100% workload\n\n, which in turn means, there will be no dead time.\n\nHybrid Methods\n\nSince the whole point of managing projects\n\ni\n\ns\n\nto\n\ndo it efficiently, there are always ways to enhance a particular project management method, namely by cherry-picking what works from a particular model and adding it to another general model. Examples of Hybrid Methods are the\n\nAgile+Waterfall method\n\n, the\n\nScrumban\n\n(Scrum+Kanban – check a\n\ndetailed comparison Scrum vs Kanban\n\n), the\n\nCCPM+Agile hybrid\n\n, and more. Hybrid methods can be extremely useful, depending on the project, since they can be perfectly tailored to a team or project.\n\nManaging projects\n\nwith Near Partner\n\nThe work of a Project Manager is no walk in the park, more like a trek under unpredictable conditions. What would be of an orchestra without its maestro? So, it is important to make sure your teams have strong guidance and a solid project plan or roadmap to follow.\n\nWith this in mind, many businesses opt for\n\nextended teams\n\n, which not only help complete the projects that will jumpstart the business, but also train their in-house teams. Our\n\namazing team\n\nof 30+ developers has the experience, the expertise, and the motivation that your business needs to get that project off the ground. Not sure how Near Partner can help you and your business?\n\nGet in touch with Near Partner\n\n, and let us work together to bring your vision to life.",

Marcelo Ferreira was one of the stars of the show.\n\nIn the rapidly evolving scene of technology and digital transformation, staying ahead of the curve is essential. It’s a challenge that companies and IT professionals face on a daily basis as they navigate the dynamic world of innovation. Participating in industry events and conferences, like OutSystems’ ONE Conference, is essential to ensure that Near Partner remains at the forefront of delivering inspiring digital experiences.\n\nThe ONE Conference stands out as a highly anticipated annual technology event within the OutSystems community, and this year’s edition lived up to all expectations. Our Head of Outsytems and Outsystems MVP, Marcelo Ferreira, was part of the enriching panel that shared knowledge with the community over two amazing days.\n\nAs Marcelo remarked it was “awesome to meet everyone again after many years of online events. The Outsystems community is spectacular and is the main reason why Outsystems remains at the top. It was fantastic to see all the evolution that the OutSystems Developer Cloud (ODC) has undergone in recent months.”\n\nMarcelo’s overview of Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)\n\nMarcelo’s talk was about how to unlock the power of event-driven architecture in Outsystems, which fitted in perfectly with all the dizzying evolution that the ODC is experiencing. EDA is a powerful pattern for building scalable systems and stands out for independence, flexibility, simplified troubleshooting, and the invaluable reusability of components, establishing itself as a versatile and highly efficient system design choice. This architectural approach thrives in scenarios demanding real-time data processing, scalable operations, seamless communication within microservices, efficient handling of intricate workflows, and rapid adaptability to evolving conditions.\n\nInsights from our OutSystems developers\n\nHenrique Gaspar, OutSystems Developer at Near Partner, reinforces that keeping up with new trends is key in this fast-paced environment. “These events are a good way to get a grip on how our sector is doing and what’s next in the future. Being surrounded by like-minded people in a place where we can learn from their challenges and experience.”\n\nMiguel Pereira,\n\nalso an Outsystems\n\nDeveloper at Near Partner, doubles down on the importance of these meetings “No boring stuff! The One’s conference was very focused on what developers can do to improve the quality of their work with subjects like caring for performance and having a well-defined security mindset.” Beatriz Sabino, a fellow Outsystems Developer, is looking forward to next year’s edition: “Attending the ONE conference was a fantastic experience. It was inspirational and helped me see how to better leverage OutSystems’s potential in my work.”\n\nNear Partner taking the lead\n\nLow-Code is a powerful match with major advantages for businesses of all sizes. Marcelo Ferreira, our Head of OutSystems, is at the forefront of recent developments in the field. His regular contributions, such as the recent talk at One’s conference, earned him the coveted OutSystems’ MVP status (Most Valuable Professionals).

    "content": "AI is leaving its mark across all industries, and it’s no different for app development.\n\nThis is how developers can use AI for App Development.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has taken the tech world by storm. A survey conducted by Stack Overflow in 2021 revealed that\n\n31.9% of developers\n\nworldwide considered AI and machine learning (ML) as the most exciting technologies to work with. Fast forward to 2023, and the latest Stack Overflow Developer Survey shows\n\n70% of developers\n\nare using or planning to use AI and ML in their applications.\n\nAI for App Development Use Cases\n\nWill AI for app development render developers useless?\n\nLeverage AI for app development with the best advice\n\nGlobal artificial intelligence (AI) software market size; Source:\n\nPrecedence Research\n\nFrom coding to user identity verification, the implications of AI for app development are world shattering – and we are just scratching the surface. Check out 7 use cases of AI for app development.\n\nAI for App Development\n\nUse Cases\n\nWe all know AI can make development faster, easier, and more personalised. But how exactly? These are 7 of the most exciting use cases so far.\n\nUser Identity Verification\n\nOne of the critical aspects of app development is security – ever heard of\n\nDevSecOps\n\n? – namely secure user identity verification. AI-powered facial recognition and biometric authentication systems have become the standard in enhancing security while also providing a seamless user experience. Using user identity verification AI for app development allows users to safely and easily login using facial recognition, voice recognition, and fingerprint readings, greatly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.\n\nCode Generation and Optimisation\n\nAI for app development can also be used for generating optimised code and optimising existing software. This application of AI allows devs to automate tasks – such as creating similar snippets of code over and over – allowing them to save time and effort and focus on more creative and complex aspects of app development, accelerating the overall process.\n\nNLP for Enhanced App-User Interaction\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) has revolutionised app-user interactions within apps. AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants are now smarter and more able to provide personalised assistance, answer queries and guide users through app functionalities with a nicer, human-like conversational tone. Additionally, NPL can be integrated in app code much, with many programming languages having NPL libraries, frameworks, and toolkits, ready to use.\n\nAutomated Bug Detection and Resolution\n\nDetecting and fixing bugs is a time-consuming and, frankly, quite a frustrating aspect of app development. New AI-enabled automated tools can streamline this process by testing and analysing code, identifying potential bugs, and suggesting solutions before the actual bug even happens. The obvious consequence for app development is faster development timelines, with less time wasted going through lines of code looking for a tiny but important bug.\n\nAuto-Scaling and Resource Management\n\nAI and ML can optimise app performance by scaling resources based on use patterns and by predicting workloads. AI-powered tools can assign more or less CPU and memory resources to a node, or start or stop additional application instances. This feature ensures the app remains responsive and performs well, even under varying loads. Ever heard of\n\nprogressive web apps?\n\nUI/UX Microsegmentation\n\nAI-powered design tools can create or suggest layouts, colour schemes, and visual elements based on user preferences. This helps developers design apps and create layouts that are more interesting, more appealing, and easier to navigate, optimising and enhancing the overall user experience. There are already a number of popular tools that use UX/UI AI for app development.\n\nPersonalized Content Recommendations\n\nDevelopers can also take advantage of AI for app development to suggest bespoke content recommendation. By analysing user interests and past interactions, apps can suggest content, products, or services enhancing user engagement. A high level of personalisation can increase user satisfaction and app usage.\n\nWill AI for app development render developers useless?\n\nVery short answer: no. Longer answer, still no. While AI-generated code is still not comparable to a full human developer, or even a team of developers, it is now possible to find some AI tools that are able to generate code from simple, ordinary language – a language-to-code translator of sorts. However, putting that code together to build a usable product (still) requires a seasoned human developer.\n\nThe quality of the AI-generated code relies on the capabilities of the underlying AI model. One of the largest, or possibly the largest, language models ever created, GPT-3, already handles a wide range of programming languages and generates various snippets of code. It saves time, automates repetitive tasks, and frees humans to create smart apps, and focus on more intricate aspects of app development. Its accuracy and ability to handle complex programming tasks, however, still have limitations. As AI technology continues to advance, code generation from natural language prompts is likely to become more sophisticated and accurate.\n\nLeverage AI for app development with the best advice\n\nIn AI’s fast changing landscape, expert knowledge and field experience are key. That’s where Near Partner steps in, guiding businesses through software and app development while infusing AI capabilities.\n\nAt Near Partner, we understand that every business is unique, and we’re here to be your strategic partner in bringing your vision into reality.

    "content": "So you have built a great app. There is just one problem: how do you make it stand\n\nout from the rest?\n\nThis is where App Store Optimization comes in.\n\nIn 2022 alone, Apple’s App Store grew by approximately\n\n1.6 million apps\n\n. Google Play, on the other hand, saw a\n\n3.5 million app\n\nincrease. In this expanding landscape of leisure and business\n\napps,\n\nwonder App Store Optimization has emerged as a pivotal tool. After all, even the most innovative, essential, and feature-rich apps can get lost in the sea of other applications in app stores. So why do so many brands still struggle with App Store Optimization? And what does it even mean?\n\nWhat is App Store Optimization?\n\nApp Store Optimization (ASO) is a digital marketing strategy, used to enhance the visibility and discoverability of applications on various app stores. Similarly to how Search Engine Optimization (SEO) works for websites, App Store Optimization focuses on improving the ranking of an app’s search results within the app store’s search engine. This means optimizing various elements such as the app name, keywords under the listing, descriptions and images.\n\nMost popular search queries on the Apple App Store for mobile users in the United States from January 2022 to June 2023 (index volume) Source:\n\nStatista\n\nUsing relevant keywords and compelling visuals on an app’s listing helps attract more organic traffic (referring to traffic from human or “organic” searches in the app store). Let’s say a user searches for the keyword “workout at home” while looking for an app that has a collection of exercises and workout routines. You will surely get dozens if not hundreds of hits, but probably focus your attention on the first couple of results, just like with any web search engine. The exact reason why some apps are displayed first is a well-kept secret, but from Google and Apple’s own documentation, it is clear that the app’s name and keywords, content and description matter a lot. Obviously, the reviews and rating, as well as the trustworthiness of the developer also weigh in – and can often be the deciding factor between two apps.\n\nIn short, a carefully planned and executed App Store Optimization strategy boosts app visibility, enhances user engagement, and increases conversion rates.\n\nThose that do make it, however, reap huge benefits: consumers spent more than $117 billion in apps and games in 2022\n\n, a result of 150 billion app downloads in the two most popular app stores alone. And there are plenty of other advantages for everyone involved in app making and usage.\n\nAdvantages of App Store Optimization\n\nApp Store Optimization presents important advantages for mobile app developers and marketeers.\n\nIncreased Visibility and Discoverability\n\n: People\n\nrarely ever check out the second page of search results\n\n, let alone the third or fourth. An App Store Optimization strategy helps improve your app’s visibility within app stores, making it easier for users to discover your app when they search for relevant keywords.\n\nMore Organic Downloads\n\n: More visibility leads to more organic downloads – that is, downloads that aren’t a result of paid campaigns. Not only does ranking matter, but higher-ranking results tend to lead to higher download rates.\n\nBetter User Engagement\n\n: the goal of App Store Optimization is to attract users who are interested in the app’s features – versus misguided users who stumble upon the app’s page because of poor keyword usage. This will lead to more and better engagement from the user, increasing user satisfaction and hopefully more good reviews and ratings.\n\nIncreased Conversion Rates\n\n: the ratio between the number of installs and the number of page views is the Conversion Rate.\n\nHigher User Retention\n\n: On average, the\n\nretention rate for Android apps\n\nis 22.6% one day after download, 6.5% seven days after download, and 2.6% 30 days after download. For the Apple store, the numbers are slightly better:\n\nretention rate for iOS apps\n\nis 25.6% one day after download, and 4.3% 30 days after download. The goal is to get users to keep using the app.\n\nCost\n\n–\n\nEffective User Acquisition\n\n: organic downloads, as seen above, are a much more cost-effective way of getting users to become customers, without the need to spend on paid campaigns.\n\nAdaptation to Algorithm Changes\n\n: app store algorithms change over time, with different ranking criteria having different weights, and with even new criteria. By actively engaging in an App Store Optimization strategy, your marketing department is more likely to stay informed about these algorithm changes, and to be quick to respond to them, improving or maintaining your app’s rankings.\n\nWhat are the limitations of App Store Optimization?\n\nApp Store Optimization is a great strategy for businesses. However, there are some hurdles along the way.\n\nTo begin with, developers, creators and marketeers have\n\nvery limited control over the app store algorithms\n\nthat determine search ranking and visibility. They are controlled by the platform providers and aren’t always fully transparent. With this in mind, app store ranking is a\n\nvery\n\ncompetitive landscape\n\n, as there are millions of apps in app stores competing for visibility.\n\nSimilarly, a good ranking is partly\n\ndependent on user ratings and reviews\n\n. Positive ratings and reviews go a long way for an app’s credibility and ranking, but nevertheless, the opposite is also true.\n\nLanguage and localization\n\nalso impact App Store Optimization strategies, as keywords can be challenging, depending on the market. For instance, countries with the same language may use different words to refer to the same thing, while in countries with different languages there may not be a direct translation of a keyword.\n\nHow to do App Store Optimization?\n\nThe app store algorithms aren’t static or 100% transparent and an App Store Optimization strategy needs to consider that. A successful strategy involves a combination of data-driven and creative optimization techniques, such as:\n\nRelevant Keywords:\n\nresearch, identify and use the most relevant and high-volume keywords related to your app’s functionality and purpose. Use tools like Google Keyword Planner, different App Store Optimization platforms, and competitor analysis to discover keywords that users are likely to search for.\n\nOptimize the app’s info:\n\nimportant keywords should be included in your app’s title and description to improve its visibility in search results. The description of your app should also be clear, concise, and compelling, while highlighting the apps features and functionalities and including the keyword(s). Use clear communication to convey why the app is valuable, what problems it can solve, and what makes it better than others.\n\nUse compelling visuals:\n\nwho doesn’t like eye candy? High-quality app icons, in-app screenshots, and videos are obviously more attractive than boring images or walls of text. Your images should accurately represent the app’s features and provide a glimpse of the user experience, while also be visually pleasing.\n\nGet user ratings and reviews:\n\nhave a system in place to encourage feedback from users, for example after providing (excellent) customer support. Equally important, respond to user reviews, and especially address concerns to demonstrate your commitment to user satisfaction.\n\nPromote inbound\n\nredirecting:\n\nwhile App Store Optimization aims to make your app more visible in app searches, most of your traffic should come from outside the app store, namely your website. Combining channels and driving people to the app page is as important as in-app optimization.\n\nUpdates, additions, improvements:\n\nin a few words, keep your app fresh. Apps that are more frequently updated (especially if these updates are based on user feedback) tend to get more positive and more frequent reviews. Additionally, both the Apple App Store and Google Play use the regularity of app updates as a ranking criterium.\n\nTrack your data:\n\nusing analytics to track and analyse user behaviour, conversion rates, and other relevant metrics helps identify areas for improvement in your App Store Optimization strategy.\n\nKeep in mind that App Optimization isn’t a one-time effort.  It is a continuous effort monitoring, analysing, and adapting to trends and algorithms within app stores, in order to make your app more visible and discoverable – it’s the power of consistency.\n\nApp Store Optimization done right!\n\nDiscover the potential of your idea with Near Partner app development services!

And\n\nNext Step Exec,\n\na low-code conference by OutSystems, did not disappoint: “Project Morpheus”, the new generative AI tool for low-code development, is coming. Buckle up:\n\nHow OutSystems Morpheus will change how apps are made\n\nMaking the most of OutSystems Morpheus\n\nMaking the most of Outsystems Morpheus\n\nOutSystems is a leading low-code platform. From its foundation over two decades ago, it has been set on continuous focus on innovation and democratising app development and enterprise-grade software by making it available to developers, business users and decision makers who may not have a development/tech background.\n\nWith OutSystems Morpheus, OutSystems’ generative AI tool for enterprise-grade application development, this mission just got a big boost. It will effectively enable AI to build apps from scratch. It comes packed with a host of exciting features, from visual representations of code to the ability to build entirely new apps on command.\n\nHow OutSystems Morpheus will change how apps are made\n\nOutSystems Morpheus is essentially a love story between generative AI, machine learning, cloud computing and low-code, where all of these technologies come together to help develop, edit, and extend mission-critical applications. Some features include:\n\nBuilding apps from conversational prompts:\n\nOutSystems Morpheus will make it possible to build apps from entirely natural language inputs. This means that Morpheus will allow decision makers such as C-suite executives, managements, though leaders, and other key stakeholders outside the realm of IT – to create first drafts of applications entirely from human language.\n\nAI-powered code editing: O\n\nutSystems Morpheus will be equipped with an AI-powered app editor that can suggest changes and improvements to apps and code to improve the business value of the application.\n\nVisual representation of Gen AI outputs:\n\napp-makers and ultimately developers will be able to visualise and validate generative AI outputs with visual representations such as code diagrams that show the structure and flow of the generated code, UI prototypes as a preview of what the final product looks like, or even data visualisations, for better assessment.\n\nIntegration with a range of Gen AI and natural language processing tools:\n\nthis feature can be used for a myriad of results, like translating natural language into code to generate product designs, marketing copy, creative content, and so on.\n\nBut wait, are you still pondering\n\nif your business\n\nreally\n\nneeds AI or Machine Learning\n\n? The question now is not exactly to need or not, but rather if you want to take advantages of its potential – and reap the benefits.\n\nCheck out 8 more OutSystems features you may not be aware of – and definitely should.\n\nWhy OutSystems Morpheus can be a game changer for your business\n\nIf you are thinking that OutSystems Morpheus sounds pretty convenient and practical – you are 100% right. Morpheus has the potential to make your life as a decision maker for a business easier in a lot of ways, both from a managerial and development point of view.\n\nIncreased productivity\n\n: OutSystems Morpheus enables developers to produce code more quickly.\n\nImproved quality\n\n: developers will be able to validate their progress and/or present it to leadership via AI-generated visual representations of code and apps. This will allow for faster and more consistent check-ups during development.\n\nFast Time-to-Market\n\n: applications (and other software) can now be developed more quickly with the help of the watchful eye of Morpheus, as well as automated code generation, IU prototyping, and data visualisation. Do you know how\n\nenterprise-grade low-code can speed up time to market\n\n?\n\nReduced costs\n\n: aside from faster time to market, Morpheus cuts costs by making app testing, editing and scaling more agile.\n\nMore innovation\n\n: ultimately, OutSystems Morpheus fosters innovation within an organisation, be it by providing developers with an ecosystem of generative AI tools to work with, by allowing key stakeholders to participate more actively in the process of development, or even by automating code-related tasks, freeing up more time to focus on creative and strategic aspects of development.\n\nMaking the most of OutSystems Morpheus\n\nMorpheus is a promising, exciting addition to OutSystems, but as with any tool, you need to be able to wield it correctly to make use of all its might. This requires knowledge, experience and prudence in using it. Besides, organisations should be familiar with generative AI before they can use Morpheus effectively and leverage its applications.\n\nOutSystems Morpheus is still in development, but its announcement is just a hint of what’s coming. Morpheus is about to change the way organisations develop, build, and even idealise software. At Near Partner, we are strong believers that one should not “just” adapt to change, but help drive it, in order to stay ahead.

    "content": "Even great teams have room for improvement. Learn what is a sprint retrospective and how to do it\n\nthe right way getting every single member of your team on the same page towards a successful project.\n\nSprint retrospectives help\n\nAgile teams\n\nreflect on their work, tools and processes to pinpoint what went well, and what is holding them back. But don’t be fooled by its name: sprint retrospectives are not just about dwelling in the past. This powerful tool allows developers to find actionable improvement opportunities and do a better job in the future. Learn more about sprint retrospectives, what they are used for, and how to implement it in a practical way. What we will talk about:\n\nWhat is a Sprint Retrospective?\n\nWhat is the purpose of a sprint retrospective?\n\nCommon mistakes\n\nWhat is the structure of a sprint retrospective?\n\nHow to do it and do it well?\n\nWhen to hold a sprint retrospective meeting?\n\nWhat is a Sprint Retrospective?\n\nA sprint retrospective is usually the last step (or event) of a sprint. A sprint, on the other hand, is a short period of time during which a determined amount of work will be completed; it can last a week or several, but usually not longer than a month. At the end of a sprint, comes a sprint retrospective.\n\nScrum Framework by\n\nInstitute Project Management\n\nThis is usually a meeting with the team or teams involved in the sprint. In this meeting, discussions revolve around the work developed, difficulties encountered,  team interactions, processes and tools, as well as other project-specific topics.\n\nWhat is the purpose of a sprint retrospective?\n\nThe main purposes of a sprint retrospective are:\n\nInspecting how the sprint went in terms of people, processes and tools;\n\nAssessing what went well and what went wrong;\n\nIdentifying potential improvements for the next sprint.\n\nIn other words, a sprint retrospective is an opportunity for teams to analyse and evaluate how they work, to identify ways to work better, and to plan how to implement what they learned on future sprints. Sprint retrospectives are a great way to\n\nimprove problem solving skills\n\n, efficiency, and collaboration, and to nurture a positive culture and work environment.\n\nCommon mistakes\n\nWhile sprint retrospectives are very straightforward, there are some common pitfalls that can stall progress and benefits of these meetings.\n\nLack of honest communication:\n\nteam members may feel put on the spot during a sprint retrospective and fail to bring up issues or difficulties they’ve encountered during the sprint. The solution is to create a safe space for your team to communicate openly.\n\nToo much focus on the negatives:\n\nwhile one of the purposes of a sprint retrospective is to identify what went wrong, it is equally important to focus on what went well. Focusing only on the negatives can bring down morale and cause team members to not be upfront about their issues.\n\nAllowing for “destructive” criticism:\n\nremember, criticism without suggestions of improvement is just a complaint. Make sure to encourage constructive criticism from everyone involved, and to avoid framing criticism as a reproach. Keep in mind the goal is to improve the work being developed, and not to single out any one individual.\n\nMixing per\n\nformance reviews with sprint retrospectives\n\n: For individual criticism and/or remarks, a sprint retrospective might be too exposing. Instead, deal with individual performance issues in a\n\none-on-one\n\nwith the team member, especially if they are recurrent.\n\nLong and ineffective sprint retrospective meetings:\n\nif a team of 8 attends a one-hour sprint retrospective meeting, that is eight hours of time invested into a meeting – this time better be used wisely and effectively. To avoid wasting everyone’s time, make sure to structure the meetings with clear and defined points, and to only key team members (more tips on how to do just that below).\n\nWhat is the structure of a sprint retrospective?\n\nThere are a number of formats for sprint retrospectives: Mad Sad Glad, DAKI, Sailboat, Mountain Climber, 4 L’s, KALM, Three Little Pigs, Pacman… and we could go on. The exact format is to be decided depending on the project and the team, but we suggest starting with a simple format that answers three basic questions:\n\nWhat went well?\n\nWhat didn’t go well?\n\nWhat can be improved?\n\nCombine this format with simple prompts, such as Start, Stop, Continue. These three commands answer the questions above and are easy to follow.\n\nStart: what the team should start doing (equivalent to\n\nwhat can be improved\n\n).\n\nStop: what the team should stop doing (similar to\n\nwhat didn’t go well\n\n);\n\nContinue: what the team should carry on doing (or\n\nwh\n\nat went well).\n\nTo improve the sprint retrospectives, gradually add layers, such as “what went well\n\nand why\n\n”, “what went wrong\n\nand why\n\n”, “what can be improved\n\nand how\n\n”, or\n\nwhich steps\n\nin the next sprint can benefit from these learnings.\n\nHow to do it and do it well?\n\nHere are some of the best practices for fruitful sprint retrospective meetings:\n\nLength of the sprint retrospective:\n\nAim at 45 minutes per week and per project. A sprint retrospective of a week-long sprint shouldn’t run longer than one hour, so you should be looking at 30 to 45 minutes for a weeks’ worth of work. Same rule of thumb says one and a half hours for a two-week sprint, two hours and fifteen minutes for a three-week sprint, and three hours for a month-long sprint.\n\nSet recurring sprint retrospectives\n\n: ideally, the sprint retrospectives will be a recurring event and possibly even have a set day and time of the week, like Friday’s at 9am or Monday’s at 3pm. The goal is to give teams time to prepare and organise their thoughts, contributions, and ideas.\n\nPrepare the meeting:\n\ngather the data on the project, including current progress, the issues that were resolved during the sprint and the ones still open, and others that are relevant to the meeting. Appoint a notes-taker. Organise online voting forms or other tools that require set up. Have the meeting structured and ready to go. If the team is scattered, use the\n\nse tips to be productive in online meetings\n\n.\n\nGet visual:\n\ndon’t be afraid to get a couple of different coloured markers and drawing on a whiteboard. If using a column format for your sprint retrospective, like the Start, Stop, Continue format, this can be especially useful.\n\nPromote participation:\n\nthis can take many forms, such as asking every attendee to contribute with one Start, one Stop, and one Continue, organising a vote on which improvements should be implemented in the next sprint, inviting brainstorming, etc.\n\nWhen to hold a sprint retrospective meeting?\n\nSprint retrospectives are the last of the 5 Scrum ceremonies. They are held in-between sprints, after the sprint review and before the next sprint planning. Sprint review and sprint retrospective should be kept separate, since the former deals with product and the latter with work, so not only the content will be different, but the target audience will also differ.\n\nWhen you need an Agile Partner\n\nYou have probably noticed that Agile is our thing. We preach and practise! We also have extensive experience with designing and implementing Agile strategies for our clients that have the vision but lack the experience. Our\n\never growing team\n\nis here for you.\n\nGet in touch\n\nif you need an Agile partner for your next project.",

    "content": "Performance, security, user experience. There are plenty of differences to consider\n\nwhen comparing web application vs website. These are the most important.\n\nEvery company needs a web presence, whatever the business\n\nventure\n\n,\n\nindustry or size. What business cards, flyers or printouts did in the old days, websites do today: they offer credibility,\n\nshowcase\n\nthe\n\nbrand\n\nand reach more potential customers. Web Applications, however, are a different breed entirely, offering a bespoke experience, where users can interact with the company in\n\nmeanin\n\ngful, digital ways. From a business and technical perspectives, the two could not be more different.\n\nWhat is a Website, really?\n\nA website is a collection of webpages that are interlinked, contained under one single domain. They are used to display information and can contain some interactive features (such as sig\n\nning up for a newsletter) but are mostly static, which explains why most websites are built using\n\nCSS\n\n, HTML, and Java\n\nScript\n\n. Nowadays there are\n\nmore than one billion\n\nof\n\nthese online\n\n.\n\nWhat is a Web Application?\n\nA web application (or web app) is a piece of software accessible via a browser, using a URL just like a website, that\n\nruns\n\non a web server. Unlike websites, a web application is dynamic and interactive. End users can manipulate or modify information. In essence, a web application helps a user complete a task.\n\nSource:\n\nMedium\n\nThere are some specific types of web apps. Portals, for example, integrate diverse applications and content. A bank’s web portal allows users to pay bills, check account balance, or wire money. Online stores are another type of web app, obviously used to browse, save products to a shopping cart, and purchase. Web applications are usually built on scripting languages like PHP or Java and rely on SQL databases. They often make use of augmented rich Internet application (RIA) technologies, such as JavaFX or Silverlight.\n\nSome very popular web applications are Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Skype, YouTube, and Amazon. Web apps often have mobile app versions – which, by the way, are not\n\nthe same thing\n\n.\n\nWeb Application vs Website: what’s right for your business?\n\nAnd now, the million-dollar question: should your business have a website and a web application? Well, the answer depends on many factors. See below a side-to-side comparison of web application vs website.\n\nWeb\n\nApplicat\n\nion vs Website: verdict\n\nWebsites are a great starting point for any business. They offer criticial information, answer frequently asked questions (FAQ), troubleshooting guidance, and can possess simple interactions with users, such as on-page purchases or an automated online chat feature.\n\nA web application, on the other hand, is a fantastic way to offer mobile experiences while bypassing app store approval. Both web applications and websites allow push notifications via browser, can be used in any platform – Linux, MacOS, Windows – and device, don’t need to be installed, and need only a browser and internet connection to be accessed.\n\nSo, the question of web application vs website comes down to:\n\nWhat service or product does your business provide?\n\nWhat is the purpose of your web solution?\n\nHow do you expect your customers to interact with it?\n\nHow many resources can your business invest in its development?\n\nGrow your digital presence with Near Partner\n\nIn need of\n\na reliable development partner\n\n, who can understand your business needs and your vision to provide practical solutions? At Near Partner, we have years of experience helping customers bring their projects to life by providing custom solutions to very specific business requirements.\n\nTake a look at the\n\nSoftware Development\n\nsolutions we offer,\n\nor just get in touch if you are unsure of how we can help your business.\n\nGet in touch\n\nwith Near Partner, and let our talented team help you materialise your vision.",

    "content": "From running to productivity, from learning to communicating, consistency allows us to\n\ntransform our abilities, unlock our potential, and achieve excellence in any domain.\n\nLast month, I had the opportunity to visit Prague, the beautiful capital of the Czech Republic. It was my first time in the city, but I was not there only for tourism. I was there to participate in the half marathon. This was the moment the power of consistency became evident to me.\n\nIt was six years since I had begun running, just around the block in the beginning. A few years of dedicated training allowed me to complete the 21.1-kilometer race with a smile on my face. I consistently surpassed my personal records and felt a tremendous sense of accomplishment. However, it would not be possible without consistent small steps through time and effort.\n\nConsistency is not limited to running; it has come to play a significant role in many aspects of my life. Consistency is crucial for maintaining good health and fitness by practicing regular exercise, balanced nutrition, and consistent sleep patterns. Prioritizing healthy habits allows us to achieve long-term fitness goals and prevent health issues. Additionally, consistent engagement and reliability are essential for fostering healthy relationships, personal growth and development, financial stability, personal well-being, and long-term success and happiness.\n\nCommitment and reliability in long-term results\n\nMy personal and professional journey has taught me that if we commit to regular practice and persistent effort, we can witness remarkable improvements in various aspects of our lives. When we consistently demonstrate reliability and integrity through our words and actions, we build trust in others and in ourselves. Trust forms the foundation of meaningful relationships, whether they are with family, friends, colleagues, clients or even with us. By consistently displaying commitment and reliability, we foster trust and create a positive environment for collaboration and growth. Consistency serves as a key ingredient for any success.\n\nAnother factor that highlights the importance of consistency is its impact on achieving long-term goals. Consistency requires sustained commitment and dedication rather than occasional bursts of effort. By consistently working towards our objectives, even during times when progress seems slow, we steadily move forward. Small, consistent steps accumulate over time, leading to meaningful results. Embracing consistency increases our chances of achieving long-term success as we maintain focus and momentum while overcoming obstacles along the way.\n\nConsistency also plays a crucial role in habit formation, shaping our daily lives. Whether it involves developing healthy habits such as regular exercise or professional habits such as always meeting deadlines, consistency is key. Engaging in desired behaviors regularly allows them to become ingrained in our routines, requiring less effort and conscious decision-making. Consistency helps transform desired actions into automatic habits, resulting in greater efficiency and productivity across various areas of life.\n\nHow do we value consistency in Near Partner?\n\nAt Near Partner, consistency is recognized and honored as a primary factor in areas such as time management, communication, and leadership. Consistency in prioritizing tasks, following routines, and maintaining a structured schedule contributes significantly to long-term success.\n\nBy consistently practicing effective communication skills, such as active listening and clear articulation of thoughts, we can develop stronger interpersonal relationships and foster meaningful connections. In leadership, consistency in demonstrating strong values, making fair decisions, and communicating expectations builds trust, morale, and a positive work environment.\n\nThere are many things that can curtail how much better we can grow to be. One of those is the short-term mindset. The habits that make you better should not be something you do, they should be something you assimilate, incorporate, and embody. At Near Partner, we recognize and emphasize its importance. That’s why we try to give everyone time and latitude to learn and grow. Because we know that it takes time and persistence.\n\nA good record is not achieved on race day\n\nA long run is won in the countless hours of training, the early morning runs, and the moment of pushing past your comfort zone. The race is simply the celebration of commitment and hard work. In a world that often seeks instant gratification, the power of consistency is frequently overlooked. However, those who understand and harness this power find themselves on a trajectory toward success. Whether it is lacing up your running shoes, sitting down to write, or embarking on a new skill, consistency holds the key to unlocking your potential and achieving greatness. So, embrace the power of consistency, take that first step, and watch as your journey unfolds, one stride at a time.\n\n“In the short term, you are as good as your intensity. In the long term, you are as good as your consistency.” Shane Parish\n\nPedro after completing the Prague half marathon",

    "content": "There are plenty workflow apps out there that promise more efficiency, speed and flexibility.\n\nHere is Near Partner’s dream combination to help businesses achieve their goals.\n\nWhat are workflow apps?\n\nNear Partner’s workflow apps toolkit\n\nSuperpowers of our toolkit\n\nLooking for a partner for your next project?\n\nAt Near Partner, a Project Manager can handle, on average, one to three projects at the same time, depending on the project manager expertise and the complexity of the projects assigned. With so many moving parts, different customers, stakeholders and teams, it is no wonder that most managers end up juggling with at least two, and for some, up to ten different tools, from Google Sheets or Excel to more fancy or custom-built apps.\n\nWhat are workflow apps?\n\nSo, how do workflow applications come into the picture? Also known as a workflow management app, a workflow application is a software application designed to simplify and automate the flow of tasks, activities and information in a business or organization. It helps to optimize and standardize processes, ensuring that work is routed efficiently through various stages and completed in a systematic way.\n\nBut it is easy to feel overwhelmed and lost with all the existing alternatives and all the new apps appearing everyday on the market, selling wonders and new exciting features that should revolutionize your work. We believe that we should keep it simple and limit the tools used to have a comfortable experience and not lose track of anything.\n\nBased on our experiences and the various projects we already managed, we believe we discovered the perfect tool combo that suits most of a Project Manager needs. We use them to manage internal and external projects at Near Partner, but they are also used by our Marketing, Human Resources, Office Management and Finance teams.\n\nThese are the tools we recommend to build your perfect toolkit:\n\nNear Partner’s w\n\norkflow apps\n\ntoolkit\n\nFor day-to-day project management, we use several integrated and connected Atlassian’s products, which are “out-of-the-box with the features and best practices agile teams need to develop and evolve their agile practices”, making project and data management way easier. By having high levels of customization, they can easily fit to each project’s needs. No, we are not paid to write this article, but we are truly enthusiasts of their products.\n\nJira Software\n\nStarting with Jira Software, our virtual team board which enables having all stakeholders on the same page, thanks to the transparency and clarity of the project, tasks status and progress, resources allocation, roadmaps, visual display of any blockers or issues, and communication and traceability of feedback through the use of comments. Jira also helps us in all our\n\nScrum\n\nceremonies, when it comes to planning and estimating the project remaining effort and the next sprints, showing the current state of the project during the daily stand-up, selecting the items that were closed during the last sprint for the demonstration or checking the burndown or burnup charts at the retrospective to find insights.\n\nJira\n\nprovides a high flexibility in terms of board visual display and workflow configuration, allowing the customization for each project. By adding columns in the board, stages in the flow, displaying critical elements in the ticket card, you’ll end up having all the information you need at a glance, in a quick and easy way. By adding custom filters to your board, you can display all the tickets assigned to only one person, or the ones that are unassigned, or even the ones that were recently updated. All these tricks, summed up, enables you to save a lot of time at the end of the day!\n\nConfluence\n\nContinuing with\n\nConfluence\n\n, another integrated Atlassian product. We commonly use Confluence to register, gather and organize all information linked to the project, such as a description of the project goal, good practices, onboarding process, procedures to follow, technical information, team composition, contact persons information, useful links, and much more. At Near Partner, we also use it as our “family library”, a manual on how to navigate Near Partner’s processes and assets as a team member.\n\nBitbucket\n\nBitbucket\n\n, on the technical side, simplifies the collaboration on code during peer reviews, as it is easy to track comments, approvals and corrections (a bit harder to understand if you’re not a code wizard).\n\nTrello\n\nThe last Atlassian tool, maybe less used because serving more Project Managers individual needs instead of team ones, is\n\nTrello\n\n. It enables organizing and tracking your notes, tasks, or one-to-one meetings insights, in an easy and visual way.\n\nMicrosoft Teams\n\nAs communication is a crucial part of any project, it is important to have a tool enabling direct messaging, group chats, file sharing and online meetings. To upgrade the communication, we use some functionalities on\n\nTeams\n\n, such as creating chats on a specific topic, tagging people in a group or using the “Important” tag.\n\nIf you never used these functionalities, give it a try, and you’ll be surprised by the results.\n\nParticipative tools\n\nWe usually use\n\nMiro\n\nfor brainstorming activities, teambuildings or retrospectives, due to its user-friendly white board accessible by the whole team and stakeholders at the same time and its high level of customization enabling you to use your company’s identity visuals.\n\nThe last two tools we commonly use are\n\nFigma\n\nand\n\nDraw.io\n\n. They enable to clarify what the final result should like, in a visual way. Where Figma is mostly used by our UX designers to create wireframes or mockups, to give orientation about visual design, Draw.io is mainly used to design process and user journeys, define which actions happen, complementing your design and detailing the user experience.\n\nSuperpowers of our toolkit\n\nImplementing these workflow apps facilitates collaboration and transparency between the team and stakeholders. By keeping everyone on the same page with up-to-date information and clear communication, misunderstandings and duplicated efforts are minimized, leading to reduced risks and increased project efficiency. As a result, projects are delivered faster, with higher quality and optimized resource allocation, saving time and money. The benefits extend to everyone involved, from the Project Manager, who gains valuable insight into project performance, to team members, who work cohesively with defined roles, and the client, who receives real-time updates and active involvement in project progress. Adopting these tools becomes a vital strategy to achieve project success.\n\nWe have been talking a lot about Agile and how it allows us to be faster and more efficient, right? These workflow apps act as our flashlights to realistically help companies on their evolving goals while using an\n\nAgile philosophy\n\n.\n\nLooking for a partner for your next project?\n\nIther way, we can help. At Near Partner, our incredible team is ready (and eager) for a challenge. We thrive in helping our customers reach their goals with our dream workflow apps toolkit. We can also advise you about which solution works best, having your business and your team in mind.\n\nGet in touch\n\nwith Near Partner and get your project up and running.",

    "content": "SaaS has experienced explosive growth in recent years. It is now an essential part of the digital landscape and, as of 2023, the global market value for\n\nSaaS solutions will come close to the 200 billion USD\n\nwatermark. The largest SaaS company by valuation? You guessed it,\n\nUS-based giant Salesforce\n\n. However, competition is fierce, and with it comes new, exciting solutions. These are 8 SaaS trends that will be on everyone’s lips in the next couple of years.\n\nThe SaaS trends you should keep an eye on\n\nLeverage the emerging SaaS trends with Near Partner\n\nThe SaaS trends you should keep an eye on\n\nSaaS stands for Software-as-a-Service. SaaS providers, such as Salesforce, host applications centrally and make them available to end-users on a subscription or freemium basis. They manage data, applications, runtime, middleware, servers, and storage. In return, the software is easily accessible, cost-effective, easy to scale, and maintain. These are 8 leading SaaS trends rocking this steaming landscape.\n\n1.\n\nArtificial Intelligence & Machine Learning\n\nFrom Elon Musk’s latest tweet to Chat GPT’s newest update, AI seems to be always trending. This is a hugely complex topic, whose ultimate goal is to create machines that “think” like humans – that is, do more than understand commands but also interpret context and information like a human would. AI is already used in a range of products, from digital personal assistants and customer service chatbots to self-driving cars. Yet, for all the buzz around AI, we’ve only just scrapped the surface of what it can do.\n\nA glimpse of Salesforce’s Einstein engine forecasting marketing results;\n\nSource:\n\nSalesforce\n\nIn the next few years, AI will be increasingly present and integrated into our day-to-day activities. Specifically for SaaS, benefits range from hyper-personalization digital experiences to high-quality customer support, security breach identification, production of social media content or predictive financial reports, to name just a few. Crucially, AI enables easier code review and maintenance for developers.\n\nMachine Learning (ML), AI’s predecessor, is already used in several SaaS products, but few players today match Salesforce’s ML capabilities. The world’s leading and most powerful CRM can detect even the slightest patterns in customer behaviour and provides insightful suggestions to the sales team based on the data gathered. ML and analytics together have the power to optimise Business Intelligence and provide predictive analytics.\n\n2.\n\nMicro-SaaS\n\nSimply put, micro-SaaS are subscription-based applications that target niche marketing. A micro-SaaS product can be an extension or add-on to a larger offer that optimizes the experience for specific industries – the opposite of a “one size fits all” approach. Micro-SaaS businesses focus on developing and delivering highly targeted applications or services to a specific niche market. They are characterized by their smaller teams, simpler infrastructure, and narrower customer base. These are lower-risk and less expensive, so it is natural to expect this sector to boom. Micro-SaaS applications can be developed to serve various industries and niches. Here are a few examples:\n\nProject management tools for specific industries: Micro-SaaS businesses can create project management software tailored to the needs of a particular industry, such as construction, healthcare, or marketing.\n\nNiche analytics platforms: Micro-SaaS companies can provide specialized analytics tools designed for specific domains like social media analytics, e-commerce analytics, or financial data analysis.\n\nHR and employee management solutions: Micro-SaaS businesses can develop HR software that caters to the unique needs of small businesses or specific industries, focusing on features like employee onboarding, payroll management, or performance evaluation.\n\nBooking and reservation systems: Micro-SaaS applications can offer booking and reservation solutions for specific sectors such as event management, salon, and spa appointments, or restaurant table reservations.\n\nCustomer support tools: Micro-SaaS businesses can create customer support platforms or ticketing systems with features customized for industries, such as healthcare, e-commerce, or software development.\n\nNiche e-commerce platforms: Micro-SaaS companies can develop specialized e-commerce solutions catering to specific markets, such as handmade crafts, subscription boxes, or digital products.\n\n3.\n\nVertical SaaS\n\nStill on the topic of niches, but on a grander scale, the next trend is vertical SaaS. While horizontal SaaS targets a wider range of customers and provides solutions based on the common needs across most industries (e.g. accounting services), vertical SaaS is geared towards a specific customer segment (e.g.\n\nfield service management software or agricultural solutions\n\n).\n\nHorizontal vs Vertical SaaS; Source:\n\nPayPro\n\nVertical SaaS is on the rise. The market is not as saturated as horizontal SaaS. Also, it is easier to deliver personalised and custom software with vertical SaaS rather than horizontal SaaS.\n\n4.\n\nMulti-cloud and hybrid cloud architectures\n\nFlexibility is definitely one of the SaaS key traits, specifically when it comes to architecture. Multi-cloud architecture allows businesses to use SaaS software without being locked into a single provider – needless to say, vendor lock in is out of the SaaS trends.\n\nA hybrid cloud architecture gives businesses the capability to integrate their on-premises technology with SaaS solutions and cloud-based systems. This ensures the benefits of cloud computing, such as scalability and cost-efficiency, while leveraging existing systems for extremely sensitive data.\n\n5.\n\nAPI integrations galore\n\nAPI (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols and tools for developing software that allows systems to communicate and share data with each other. For example, a SaaS solution can make use of an API to integrate with other existing systems, such as ERP or systems.\n\nWorld’s favourite APIs by number of executions in 2022; Source:\n\nPostman\n\nSince APIs\n\nacts as a bridge between two systems, they can serve as a basis to develop other SaaS solutions, simply by creating new applications on top of the platform, adding custom features and with no changes to the underlying software.\n\nTaking advantage of APIs opens up new business opportunities for SaaS providers and is convenient for businesses. Additionally, API technology itself is also going through a phase of transformation, with security becoming more critical, the rising importance of API analytics and open-source options. Any upcoming SaaS trends will be intimately connected to API development and improvement.\n\n6. 5G and Edge Computing\n\n5G means a great deal to developers\n\n, mostly because it enables a world of opportunity for real-time and low latency applications. For SaaS providers, 5G means faster and more reliable connections, real-time data analysis and processing, as well as the ability to leverage edge computing.\n\nEdge computing, on the other hand, is a distributed network architecture, that processes and manages data where it is generated, rather than on a centralized resource. Edge computing is especially relevant where IoT devices are involved. By processing the data closer to the source – at the edge – SaaS providers can reduce latency, improve security, and reduce the amount of data that needs to be sent to the cloud for processing, effectively saving time, costs, and bandwidth.\n\nUse cases for 5G and edge computing include self-driving vehicles, virtual and augmented reality, healthcare, or traffic management – basically every application where low-latency, performance, and scalability matter. Edge computing would be impossible without 5G networks, and edge-based SaaS on 5G networks is one of the most promising SaaS trends for the next years.\n\n7. White-label SaaS\n\nWhite-label software is unlabelled, unbranded software produced by one company that can be bought, branded, and used by other brands. A white-label SaaS provider offers it unlabelled products to other businesses. The resellers then brand it and offer it as their own solution, without the need to develop or maintain the software themselves. The responsibilities of the original provider are the technical aspects, such as hosting, maintenance, and upgrades, while the reseller takes responsibility for customization, sales, marketing, and customer service.\n\nMost white-label SaaS are customisable so they can be made to seem native to the businesses that buys them. This is a great advantage to small and medium size companies, allowing them to compete with larger players that have more resources to develop their own software from scratch.\n\n8. Blockchain SaaS\n\nToday, most applications of blockchain technology revolve around transactions and verifications, such as secure payments, ID checks, and data storage. Blockchain SaaS, or BaaS, may be about to change that.\n\nSaaS, Blockchain-as-a-Service, or BaaS are cloud-based services that enable businesses to create, host, manage, and deploy their own blockchain networks, with a fraction of the investment in hardware or skilled technical support. SaaS solutions benefit from the transparency, decentralization, and security of blockchain – like a\n\ndecentralized marketplace\n\n, for example.\n\nHere are two examples of companies that are using Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) solutions:\n\nWalmart: Walmart, one of the world’s largest retailers, has implemented blockchain technology through a BaaS solution. They use BaaS to track and trace the journey of certain products in their supply chain, such as fresh produce. By leveraging blockchain technology, Walmart can enhance transparency and traceability, ensuring the authenticity and quality of its products.\n\nMaersk: Maersk, a global shipping company, has also embraced BaaS for supply chain management. They have partnered with IBM and utilized the IBM Blockchain Platform to create a secure and efficient system for tracking shipping containers. This blockchain-based solution provides real-time visibility into the location and condition of containers, reducing paperwork and improving overall supply chain efficiency.\n\nThese examples demonstrate how companies from different industries are utilizing BaaS solutions to enhance transparency, traceability, and efficiency in their operations.\n\nLeverage the emerging SaaS trends with Near Partner\n\nThe SaaS space is changing rapidly, and it can be hard for businesses to keep up. At Near Partner we have a vast team with specialists in SaaS technology, with a strong focus on Salesforce products. Our range of services includes:\n\nSalesforce services\n\n;\n\nCustom SaaS app development.\n\nThird-party integration services.\n\nSaaS application & platform consulting.\n\nSaaS maintenance & support.\n\nWe deliver tailored solutions that fit\n\nour customers’\n\nneeds and business requirements.

    "content": "From generative AI to light components, these are 6 of the hottest UX/UI trends right now.\n\nIt used to be so simple. Building a great UX (short for “user experience”) or UI (for “user interface”) used to be about choosing the right visual elements, forms and buttons, set them in the place and try not to overburden users with questions you really did not need answered. Today, more competition, performance demands and groundbreaking advances in AI mean UX/UI can make or break any website or app, no matter how many great features they pack under the hood. On average,\n\nevery $1 invested in UX/UI results in an ROI of between $2 and $100\n\n. After all, what is the point of having a killer-app if users can never really understand its full scope?\n\nHere is what we will cover:\n\nGenerative AI in the design process\n\nLight components\n\nDesign for accessibility\n\nVR & AR UI design\n\nCross-platform design\n\nMinimalism\n\nOne key issue may be understating what even is UX/UI in the first place. Although frequently mashed together, they represent different elements. Simply put,\n\nuser experience design (UX)\n\nis the process of planning the experience a person has when interacting with a product. The goal is to turn the use of products and services, both digital or physical, into something easy, logical, and all-round pleasant. On the other hand,\n\nuser interface design (UI)\n\ncreates the look and feel of a website or application, in other words, the graphical layout. The purpose is to make even the most complex apps visually appealing, using typography, colour palettes, buttons, animation, responsive design and other imagery to provide a smooth experience.\n\nIn short, a UX designer ensures that users find value in what is provided to them, and a UI designer provides consistency within a product’s visual look. However, they are both crucial when developing a product. As UX/UI trends are constantly changing, designers need to be on their toes to create high-quality and fully functioning products. Here are 6 UX/UI trends to look out for in 2023.\n\n1. Generative AI in the design process\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the digital world, and is gunning for the design industry next. Generative AI uses machine learning to create unique designs based on user input, accelerating the design process. From logos to web designs, visuals can be crafted more quickly and efficiently. Looking beyond, we’re getting closer to generate User Interfaces automatically, or even predict UIs. Looks familiar? A sample of AI generated images (spoiler: none are real!)\n\nSource.\n\nTech Monitor\n\nSome of the most popular Adobe tools already support features that use generative AI technology. For example, “Puppet Warp” is a tool embedded in Photoshop to make significant alterations in images such as move an arm, correct a head tilt, lengthen legs, and completely re-shape objects and so on. Face-Aware Liquify, also in Photoshop, automatically detects facial features and helps you adjust them to enhance a portrait. These editing tool use AI to allow designers to complete their daily tasks faster. Take them a step further and it is not hard to imagine a custom interface for every website visitor. This is one of the UX/UI trends that is here to stay.\n\n2. Light components\n\nThe rise of Lightning Web Components (LWC), an addition to the Salesforce Framework, is another UX/UI trend to look out for. It has proven to be a game changer, as it provides a richer and modern interface for its users, with the vital ingredient: flexibility. You can also style your components with SLDS (Salesforce Lightning Design system) which has a comprehensive design system, that follows modern web standards, taking advantage of\n\ncustom elements, templates\n\n, modules and other language components already available to speed development and save time testing.\n\n3. Design for accessibility\n\nAccessibility is more than a trend, it is now mandatory in some regions – such as every country in the EU. The European Accessibility Act was purposely created to foster a more inclusive society, making technology accessible to everyone, including persons with disabilities or impairments, and the elderly. The new regulations promise to greatly impact the development of websites and apps.\n\nFor starters, a deeper understanding of UX/UI principles is needed to design for a wider range of users. Some of the best practices include using ALT text for images, closed captions and transcripts for video content, screen-reading options, and screen magnification. A new set of accessibility design standards and guidelines should be taken into account in every project.\n\n4. VR & AR UI design\n\nVirtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) are ripe to change the future of UX/UI design. With the Internet of Things, the flat and screen-oriented user experience is becoming more organic and authentic, as felt in the real world. This requires brand new graphical user interfaces that can overlay the AR or VR experience.\n\nFor instance, a VR website experience can induce a user to experience the same sense of motion as when driving a car. AR can be used to build environments that help clients understand how they would feel in a certain space, say a new home. Designing an extended reality, virtual and augmented, is a new and fascinating field.\n\n5. Cross-platform design\n\nAlthough this is not a new concept, many products do not yet provide a seamless user experience across multiple devices, such as desktop, mobile or tablet. But what even is a true cross-platform experience?\n\nA cross-platform experience (also called platform-agnostic design) describes the user experience comparison across multiple devices, including Web, mobile, tablet, and wearables, besides operating systems like iOS, Android, Windows or Mac. The aim is to ensure end users can access the same features and complete tasks regardless of device or operating system. For example, the ability to make a payment from your bank account whether you use the bank’s web portal or mobile app. Cross-platform design is a broader concept than responsive design because it must consider web browsers, and operating systems, in addition to a user’s devices.\n\n6. Minimalism\n\nMinimalism has been a popular UX/UI trend for several years now, and it shows no signs of slowing down. Minimalism in design means removing unnecessary elements or content that doesn’t support user tasks, focusing on simple and straightforward components and flows. With fewer distractions, users can navigate through a clean and uncluttered look, easily absorbing and processing the information.\n\nFlat design and negative space are some of the most used elements in minimalistic aesthetics. Google, Microsoft, and Apple pioneered this concept and, since then, it has become a trend in the UI and UX design world. In the end, users don’t need more screen space, they just need less stuff.\n\nNear Partner, forward-looking UX/UI trends\n\nUX/UI trends improve the overall experience with a given product, adapting to the ever-evolving technology and user demands. So, if you’re in need to speed up a project and deliver a high-quality product, we can help.\n\nGet in touch\n\n!",

    "content": "Want to get a new perspective on “always do your best”? It’s not just about meeting expectations.\n\nThis is Near Partner’s vision of achieving long-term success.\n\nOn the first week with Near Partner, everybody has a meeting with me. People usually don’t recall much from that meeting, except that it existed. But most will remember the 4 agreements I base our common relationship in:\n\nBe impeccable with your word.\n\nDon’t take things personally.\n\nDon’t make assumptions.\n\nAlways do your best.\n\nAlthough the other 3 are talked about from time to time, the last one, is the least considered: “Always do your best”. One of the reasons is because everyone has a very clear sense of what it means. And so, it seems very easy to follow. However, more often than not it is misinterpreted. It’s very often considered as an greenlight to under the par performance. It’s accepted as a guide to mediocrity. And it isn’t.\n\nThere’s a side of it that is about the limitations we might have. And many times, it’s used as an excuse for bad results: “The meeting went awfully. But, hey, I did my best!” However, the limitations are not the ones you find when you show up for whatever will measure the result. The limitations are the ones you have along the way, up to that day. “The time I had does not permit more.” But it’s not the time you had because you spent a long time at the beach or playing videogames. It’s the limitation although you put all the effort rationally acceptable.\n\nDoing your best is all about making sure that when you show up, you do it with your best self. When we are saying “always do your best” we are expecting you do everything within the reasonable realm to be your best self. Shane Parrish put it very nicely the other day in Farnam Street: “Doing your best is about the position you find yourself in when you show up. Over the long term, the average person who constantly puts themselves in a good position beats the genius who finds themselves in a poor position. What looks like talent is often good positioning. And the best way to put yourself in a good position is with good preparation.”\n\nIf you want to learn more about how to achieve success by doing your best, check out the\n\nfull post by Shane Parrish on Farnam Street\n\n. It takes only 5 minutes of your time and it’s packed with interesting insights.\n\nAnd always do your best.",

    "content": "With Salesforce LWR, you can build modern web apps that offer great digital experiences\n\nwithout compromising performance, security, or scalability.\n\nVibrant digital communities, self-service knowledge bases, engaging web portals with vital data and KPIs. These are just some of the broad applications of the new Salesforce Lightning Web Runtime (LWR). The long-awaited improvement on Experience Cloud is finally here and it features significant performance improvements, especially for large-scale applications, while maintaining high security standards and intuitive interface. This is what it means and why it could be a gamechanger.\n\nLet’s do it:\n\nWhat is Salesforce LWR?\n\nSalesforce LWR: the advantages\n\nSalesforce LWR: use cases\n\nHow to: step-by-step\n\nLooking to create a rich, interactive application with Salesforce LWR?\n\nWhat is Salesforce LWR?\n\nEssentially, the Salesforce Lightning Web Runtime (LWR) is a frontend-development tool by Salesforce. It can be used by citizen-developers and software developers to create web applications using 100%\n\nLightning Web Components (LWC)\n\n, making it high-performance, easy to use, and lightweight.\n\nSalesforce LWR\n\n: the advantages\n\nSalesforce LWR was developed to be the standard platform for frontend in the Experience Cloud, effectively replacing Aura. The advantages of LWR are:\n\nSpeed:\n\nit is based on Lightning Web Components, meaning performance is optimized for mobile and browser apps, even for large datasets. You can effectively build a LWR site in a couple of hours.\n\nScalability:\n\nLWR sites use caching to improve the performance, making them extremely responsive to high volumes, and effective in scaling accordingly.\n\nSecurity:\n\nLWR sites use Lightning Web Security (LWS), the brand-new security architecture for LWC. Therefore, data is protected.\n\nDesign flexibility:\n\nthanks to the LWC, there is much more flexibility in design, seeing as you can use the available templates or create your own from scratch.\n\nControl\n\n: it offers full control and greater developer experience, being perfect for open-ended cases.\n\nHowever, Salesforce LWR has some limitations. The current version is still missing some out-of-the-box themes and theme management, multilingual sites, and progressive rendering. Nevertheless, these probably won’t be limitations for much longer, as it grows, and the platform expands.\n\nSalesforce LWR\n\n: use cases\n\nSalesforce allows you to set up and customize responsive web portals to suit your needs and company branding. For instance, say you are building a Customer Account Portal. This is where members can log in, access, and manage their accounts, create and manage cases or claims. This type of self-service knowledge base can be useful to let customers find the answers to their questions quickly and efficiently, without having to contact your organization. Such portal improves customer relationships and decreases service costs – and you can accomplish  that by using one of Salesforce LWR out-of-the-box templates, ensuring speed and safety. Or you can build your own custom digital space to align with your specific requirements.\n\nPartner portals are another common use case for Salesforce LWR. This means you can build an efficient, engaging hub where partners can connect with each other, and your company, to work on driving channel sales. It’s the place to share CRM data and information with your partners, collaborate on prospects and deals, manage leads, opportunities, and accounts in real time, forecast channel sales, track performance, streamline channel marketing, partner education and onboarding. You can create this type of portal using one of LWR templates or customized to suit your needs.\n\nBut the true scope of Salesforce LWR is practically endless. You can use it to build almost anything, from an employee onboarding portal to a website where staff can track training sessions, or even a brand-new home for your vibrant customer community, where members can talk to one another and engage in meaningful discussions. It all depends on your organization’s ambition. And it could not be easier to get started.\n\nHow to: step-by-step\n\nCreating a LWR site is pretty straightforward in Salesforce LWR:\n\nFrom Setup, type\n\nDigital Experiences\n\nin the Quick Find box. Select\n\nAll Sites\n\nand click\n\nNew\n\n.\n\nNext, select\n\nBuild Your Own (LWR)\n\nor\n\nMicrosite (LWR)\n\n, and click\n\nGet Started\n\n.\n\nEnter a name and base URL value.\n\nChoose an authentication process:\n\nUnauthenticated\n\nfor a public site accessible to anyone on the web or\n\nAuthenticated\n\nfor a site that requires login credentials.\n\nPress\n\nCreate\n\n.\n\nNow you’ve created your very first Salesforce LWR site, and the\n\nExperience Workspaces\n\narea becomes visible. This Experience Workspaces is where you will build, set up, and monitor your Experience Cloud site.\n\nLooking to create a rich, interactive application with Salesforce LWR?\n\nNear Partner is the partner you are looking for. We can help you create an application with Salesforce LWS, and also building a blazing fast CRM-friendly experience for your customers. Be it high-speed marketing websites, microsites, or extremely low page-load runtime portals, you can turn your vision into reality with our Salesforce experts at Near Partner.\n\nWorried about the current limitations? No need.

    "content": "than ever before and how to build one for your business.\n\nProgressive Web Apps can turn a website into an app. The lovechild of a web application and a native application, they have never been more relevant than right now. Sounds intriguing? Here is what it means exactly and how to build them.\n\nTopics we will cover:\n\nProgressive Web Apps: turning websites into apps\n\nHow to build great Progressive Web Apps\n\nProgressive Web Apps: turning websites into apps\n\nWeb applications are incredibly accessible. They reach everyone, everywhere and in every device, as long as there is an internet connection. They are, however, hardly adapted for a mobile experience. Mobile native apps, on the other hand, work seamlessly in every device, making for a great user experience. But they do require users to search, download, and install them, an effort that many are only willing to take if this is an app they will use repeatedly.\n\nSource:\n\nGomage\n\nProgressive Web Apps combine the best of both worlds. They are fast, responsive, interactive, and secure. They are installable, discoverable, cross-platform, network independent, capable and reliable. You probably already use them. Some known progressive web apps that are making success are Starbucks, Spotify, Uber (for web), Pinterest. Even Tinder hopped along the progressive web app band wagon with Tinder Online.\n\nHow to build great Progressive Web Apps\n\nFor a progressive web app to succeed, you need to ensure you’ve ticked off a couple of things:\n\nCreate a Manifest\n\nThe manifest is the heart of a progressive web app. The manifest is a JSON file that pretty much makes the app installable. Better yet than just creating a manifest, expand it with shortcuts! This equips the progressive web app with the same functionalities of native apps, such as when you press the icon for a few seconds, and you get a drop-down menu with a selection of predefined actions.\n\nUse a service worker\n\nAnd if a manifest is the heart, then a service worker is the respiratory system of a progressive web app. Service workers (not the human ones) enable the user of your progressive app to use it while offline, by relying on technology to load it in the background. A service worker also gives you access to all the fun bits like push notifications, caching, install prompts, and so on. Just like the manifest, add the service worker script to the base HTML.\n\nStick to the KISS principle\n\nKISS means “Keep It Simple, Stupid”. But we say it with love. Keeping your progressive web app simple is essential to avoid distracting your users with all the cool tools they now have at the distance of a tap. Get rid or minimise the distracting elements and focus on the desired actions.\n\nCentre it on the UX\n\nA progressive web app in an improvement on the user experience, but it does not work miracles. Things like filling forms and ticking captchas, load times, and many other frustrating things are the main culprits of a poor experience. So, provide your users with autofill, one-tap sign-up, “remember me” options, and ​keep forms simple to fill-out.\n\nUse a HTTPS connection\n\nMaking sure the website and thus the progressive web app is run entirely on HTTPS is crucial to guarantee its security.\n\nMake it app-like\n\nThe whole point of a progressive web app is to have all the advantages of a native app, but not the downsides, namely the size or the complex building process. Making your progressive web app “app-like”, means using simple and decluttered layouts, keeping the refreshes minimal, and transitions fast.\n\nMake it as “offline” as you can\n\nNot all progressive web apps can be made totally offline, and that’s ok. If this is the case, then make it available in low connectivity as much as you can. Provide all the key features in offline mode and enable caching to make it possible.\n\nSEO is your friend\n\nSince progressive web apps are based on websites, they have URLs and can be indexed by Google and other search engines. Follow the best SEO practices for better results on traffic and conversions.\n\nPublish your progressive web app to app stores\n\nAlthough the progressive web app does not require installation like a mobile-native app, it is smart from a marketing point of view to publish it to the app stores. This needs to be carefully done as each app store has specific requirements.\n\nGet your Progressive Web App running seamlessly\n\nA progressive web app brings together the best of a web application and of a native app, for the benefit of the user and the business. It is, after all, a much lower investment than a native app due to the difference of effort in development. A website with progressive web app capabilities can even replace native apps for iOS, Android and Windows Phone, which are often a great struggle for smaller or newer business.\n\nIf you are unsure on how to make a progressive web app happen without hiccups, you have a partner right here. At Near Partner, our skilled developers strive to create and deliver flexible and customised solutions to all our clients. We focus on customer centric solutions that help businesses achieve their success goals, independently of the size.

How do we apply UX design in Outsystems?\n\nThey say good design is invisible. When app design is executed flawlessly, and works just as it is expected to, it certainly feels that way. When it is executed poorly, however, it can steal the focus of even the most powerful apps. Staying up to date with the latest\n\nUX/UI trends\n\nis no small feat. Changes in user expectations, steep competition and an endless stream of new design tools, programming languages and technology breakthroughs such as generative AI mean that to stay ahead of the game, designers are pushed to a permanent state of creative destruction. Can low-code help?\n\nUX/UI design: when functionality meets aesthetics\n\nHow is done in Outsystems\n\nHow is done in Outsystems\n\nUX/UI design: when functionality meets aesthetics\n\nAs you’ve probably noticed, UX and UI are often associated – and styled as UX/UI. This is because they are both needed for a successful product but are not the same thing. UX comprises the whole experience a user has with a (digital) product or service. UI stands for\n\nU\n\nser\n\nI\n\nnterface and refers to the visual and functional bits that a user interacts with, such as buttons, drop-down menus, colours, shapes, icons, fonts, and more, all being part of a Design System.\n\nSo why do we see UX/UI all the time, rather than one or the other? Well, the way we see it, you cannot have one without the other. While UI is primarily focused on the visual side of things, if an app looks great but doesn’t really work well, that is a failure of both UX and UI.\n\nSo, whether we say UI is contained inside the realm of UX, a carefully planned and executed UX is essential to create a seamless UI. Both UI and UX are, then, part of a much larger Customer Experience (CX).\n\nvia Dribbble.com\n\nUX design in Outsystems\n\nTo deliver a great UX design in Outsystems, there are several points to be considered:\n\nBeautiful UI:\n\nthe “look and feel” of your app must be on point. Designing a beautiful UI is essential for a well succeeded UX.\n\nMulti-touchpoint:\n\nto build an engaging experience, you want to deliver a product that is available in any device.\n\nImmersive experiences:\n\nincorporate AI/ML intelligence and AR or VR to create immersive experiences on web, mobile, and wearables.\n\nOffline experience:\n\napps that are reliable offline without data loss and security breaches contribute to richer experiences.\n\nFortunately, Outsystems – a\n\nleading low-code provider\n\n– has just the right tool to achieve a flawless UI design, that also allows for reactive web apps and accessibility customisations from an intuitive low-code approach.\n\nHow is done in Outsystems\n\nOutsystems UI is a low code UI platform for web and mobile applications, with significant changes brewing. For instance, Outsystems UI is taking its steps to steadily replace the Silk UI platform. While Silk UI was a game changer for UI/UX design in Outsystems, nowadays, the emergence of Reactive Web apps demands better performance, asynchronous data fetching, and less latency. And these are just some of the points Outsystems UI is capable of delivering.\n\nThe main features of the framework for UI/UX in Outsystems are:\n\nOne single platform:\n\nwith only one platform Outsystems you can create both reactive web applications and native mobile applications.\n\nExtensive pattern library\n\n: the pre-built UI patterns and components for UI/UX design in OutSystems cover the most used interactions in mobile and web apps, removing the need for CSS programming. These patterns include column or grid distribution, floating content, lists, carousels, dropdown menus, sidebars, checkboxes, popups, etc.\n\nScreen templates for web or mobile\n\n: just like the pattern library, Outsystems UI platform provides various screen templates instead of a blank canvas to get started. You can choose from dashboards, directories, lists, galleries, forms, etc, and then use your own data and info to customise the page.\n\nTheme editor\n\n: the theme editor allows you to customise fonts, sizes, colours, backgrounds, headers, and overall styles from one single place, and ensure these customisations are applied consistently throughout the whole application.\n\nAccessibility\n\n: OutSystems UI components are accessible and compliant with WCAG 2.1 standards for creating accessible web content for people with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities.\n\nResponsiveness:\n\ncreating UI elements that work on different devices is easily attainable through the Outsystems classes – “.desktop”, “.phone”, and “.tablet”– without the need for CSS code.\n\nTotal customisation\n\n: although Outsystems UI is a low-code UI platform, it also offers the possibility to add custom CSS, HTML and JavaScript code to the elements, in order to extend the capabilities or functions of pre-built components.\n\nBeyond standard UX design in Outsystems with Near Partner\n\nUX design is a passion of ours at Near Partner, and so is Outsystems. We strive to deliver customised solutions to our clients, and help businesses achieve their goals beyond their potential. Whether you are interested in migration, building from scratch or improving your UX design in Outsystems, Near Partner is the right partner for you.

In short, MuleSoft allows organizations to concentrate on their core goals.\n\nMuleSoft provides security features like access control, encryption, role-based access control, secure APIs, threat protection, and compliance to ensure the security of applications and data.\n\nMuleSoft in action, from Retail to Healthcare\n\nHere are some examples of how MuleSoft can accelerate organizations’ digital transformation journey‎.\n\nRetail: making the most of customer data\n\nMuleSoft can empower retail companies to unlock data from systems such as ERP or CRM to activate digital projects faster. There are several pre-built APIs, connectors, implementation templates, and reference architecture to create 360º customer profiles. For example, a retailer of outdoor adventure gear and apparel can assemble content on a country’s destinations and make it accessible through an API, unleashing new creative uses for the data. The retailer may then make recommendations based on customer-selected criteria and cross-reference them with weather, lodging and restaurants on the area. So, MuleSoft can help retailers provide a bespoke experience across different communication channels.\n\nFinance: banking on data integration\n\nMuleSoft can unlock banking and insurance platforms by providing customers with a more connected experience. For instance, MuleSoft can build a single holistic view of each customer – and provide custom advice on their investment portfolio based on their activity. The onboarding process can also benefit from MuleSoft, as it allows opening new online accounts swiftly and securely–as opposed to traditional, time-consuming procedures. Besides, lenders can scale loan processes by streamlining customers’ data reviewing processes. All with out-of-the-box connectors for various lending systems.\n\nHealthcare: smarter diagnoses and speedier data collection\n\nMuleSoft can help patients as they collect and report data — such as blood-sugar levels for a patient with diabetes. As a result, doctors can have real-time access to more relevant information and make more precise and timely diagnoses. MuleSoft’s data can also be used to provide patients will a complete view of their medical records, doctors with a global view of their patients and HR managers with predictions of staffing requirements in a given day. Such complete data increases patient engagement and satisfaction, improves care coordination and speeds up critical information for healthcare professionals.\n\nChoosing the right partner for MuleSoft integration\n\nNow that you know what MuleSoft is, it is essential to have the right partner to ensure MuleSoft implementation. We have a large pool of Salesforce developers, consultants and engineers, ready to help you go further and faster.\n\nGet in touch\n\n!",

This is what you need to know about the programming model, its advantages and how to get started right away:\n\nLWC Salesforce: what is it?\n\nLWC Salesforce: what are the advantages?\n\nLWC Salesforce: how to implement?\n\nLooking for a LWC Salesforce Partner?\n\nLWC Salesforce: what is it?\n\nLWC Salesforce is a new web programming model for developing Lightning components on the Salesforce platform. Lightning Components is a UI framework that is used to create applications for desktop and mobile technologies. Single-page web applications can be built to provide an end-to-end experience on the platform for a variety of functions.\n\nThe new Lightning Web Components model is built from standard technology such as CSS, HTML and JavaScript. The goal is to take advantage of custom elements, templates, modules and other language components already available to speed development and save time testing.\n\nPreviously, Lightning components were developed using the Aura framework. However, Aura had its own limitations: some key elements were missing, and Aura offered only limited resources for large-scale projects. In other words, the Aura framework did not support developers in creating their own user interface components. Besides, new frameworks, such as\n\nAngular or React\n\n, were unavailable to Aura users.\n\nIn comes LWC Salesforce, which allows the development of components with no need to master the Salesforce platform – and plenty of other advantages.\n\nLWC Salesforce: what are the advantages?\n\nThere are several advantages for developers, customers and even admins. These are the main ones.\n\nEase of use\n\nUsing LWC Salesforce does not require highly specialized human resources to execute and support business needs. Finding programming talent is hard, and wasting it recreating widely available web elements seems foolish. The fact that it allows you to create web applications based on standards makes the whole process more achievable.\n\nBefore LWC Salesforce, programmers had to learn the Aura framework, and their prior knowledge did not make the task easier. On the other hand, it is something programmers already understand and master, thus optimizing their acquaintance with the system.\n\nCoexistence of Aura and LWC Salesforce\n\nAlthough it represents a significant leap forward, it is still possible to integrate Aura components with LWC Salesforce on a single webpage and, in some cases, share data. Thus, the Salesforce platform can rely on these two programming models.\n\nIt also uses responsive design, which provides an optimized and fluid user experience. This technology makes it possible to recognize different devices and browsers in order to adapt the applications design accordingly. Programmers can also rely on more advanced features like HTML5 or CSS3.\n\nIncreased security\n\nSalesforce provides Lightning Locker, a security architecture for Lightning components. It promotes best practices by isolating components from others belonging to a different namespace. This is a powerful feature in a world where security is an increasingly important topic.\n\nExtra speed\n\nThis is the key advantage of LWC. Since the architecture is based on standardization and reuse, components take less time to build. In fact, most LWC components can be implemented by drap-and-drop – of course, further customization requires an expert hand, something we take great pride in here at Near Partner. In addition, LWC is suitable for older browsers that do not yet support all underlying web standards.\n\nRendering is much faster in LWC compared to the Aura framework, due to API support, which results in superior performance. In addition, as LWC Salesforce is based on standard Web components, its framework is lighter and storage space management is more efficient.\n\nLWC Salesforce: how to implement it in practice\n\nBuilding LWCs means leveraging the Salesforce products ecosystem to make your sales team, customer service, and even marketing campaigns more efficient. And you don’t need to master a brand-new proprietary framework to get started. If you know the basics of modern web development, you’re already halfway there.\n\nAt its core, LWC builds on\n\nstandard web technologies\n\n:\n\nJavaScript\n\nhandles your logic (variables, functions, and events). You can even bring in\n\nthird-party JavaScript libraries\n\n, which is perfect for reducing code complexity or reusing functionality you already know.\n\nHTML\n\ndefines the structure of each component, while Salesforce’s\n\nvirtual DOM\n\ntakes care of rendering intelligently and efficiently in the background.\n\nCSS\n\nadds the styling and animations. Here, you have two paths: adopt Salesforce’s\n\nLightning Design System (SLDS)\n\nfor ready-to-use, responsive components that align with Salesforce’s native look and feel, or write your own custom CSS for a design that matches your brand identity exactly.\n\nThese are the practical steps to get started:\n\n1. Set up your Salesforce DX environment\n\nBefore you dive in, prepare the tools that will let you work seamlessly across the customer relationship management CRM platform. Think of this as preparing your “workbench” for building LWCs.\n\nInstall Salesforce CLI.\n\nConfigure your project workspace.\n\nAuthorize your Salesforce org.\n\nThis ensures a clean foundation to develop, test, and deploy LWCs in line with your business processes.\n\n2. Create your first LWC component\n\nLWCs are reusable, lightweight, and ideal for embedding in CRM apps across Sales Cloud, Commerce Cloud, or even Marketing Cloud Customer Data Platform. Salesforce makes this quick and straightforward.\n\nRun the sfdx force:lightning:component:create command.\n\nSalesforce will create the essential .js, .html, and .css files for you.\n\nUse meaningful names to keep your integrated platform organized..\n\n3. Structure your component with HTML templates\n\nYour component needs a skeleton: templates that bring structure to the customer information you want to display.\n\nDefine your layout and use {} syntax for data binding, perfect for sales customer service dashboards.\n\nLeverage conditional rendering and iteration when needed (great for small businesses managing multiple views).\n\nKeep your HTML clean for better maintainability.\n\n4. Add logic with JavaScript\n\nThis is where LWCs become powerful. Logic in the .js file can connect directly to emails marketing, customer service marketing automation, or even AI agents to make interactions smarter.\n\nCreate properties and methods to manage state.\n\nHandle events such as clicks, input changes, or custom triggers.\n\nLeverage APIs to connect with other Salesforce products or third-party apps.\n\n5. Style with SLDS or custom CSS\n\nGreat UX drives customer satisfaction. You can use the Lightning Design System for a native Salesforce look or tailor it to your brand.\n\nApply Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) classes for quick styling.\n\nExtend or override styles with your own CSS.\n\nUse animations and transitions for smoother user interactions.\n\n6. Test your component in Salesforce\n\nBefore going live, test across different contexts to ensure it integrates well with your platform as a service (PaaS) setup.\n\nAdd the component to a Lightning page using App Builder.\n\nTest functionality within Sales Cloud or Commerce Cloud.\n\nValidate interactions with CRM apps and customer information systems\n\n7. Deploy and iterate\n\nRoll out to your users, gather feedback, and refine. Integration across marketing campaigns, sales customer service, and other business processes will only grow stronger over time\n\nPush your code to the org with Salesforce CLI.\n\nCollect feedback from the sales team or marketing teams..\n\nContinuously optimize your LWCs for broader use across the integrated platform.\n\nCommon mistakes to avoid when implementing LWC\n\nEven though LWCs are easier to build than older frameworks, many teams fall into traps that slow adoption and reduce impact.\n\n1. Ignoring the bigger picture\n\nSome developers focus only on the technical build without considering how it supports customer relationship management CRM platform goals. An LWC is more than just a component; it’s part of the entire integrated platform that spans sales customer service, marketing automation, and emails marketing.\n\n2. Underestimating data complexity\n\nNot structuring data properly within the Marketing Cloud Customer Data Platform or mishandling customer information can result in errors and user frustration. Always map fields carefully and maintain consistency across Salesforce products.\n\n3. Over-customizing without SLDS\n\nMany jump straight to heavy CSS overrides. This leads to inconsistencies across CRM apps, hurting usability and customer satisfaction. Always leverage Salesforce Lightning Design System first.\n\n4. Skipping testing in real workflows\n\nAn LWC might look perfect in isolation but break when used in a real business process, like lead conversion in Sales Cloud or order handling in Commerce Cloud. Always test in the end-to-end flow.\n\n5. Forgetting scalability\n\nA component that works for small businesses may not perform under the load of enterprise-scale marketing campaigns or AI agents processing massive customer service marketing automation tasks. Build with growth in mind.\n\nLooking for a LWC Salesforce Partner?\n\nNow that you are familiar with LWC Salesforce, you can consider migrating Aura components to LWC and thus benefit from unprecedented productivity and performance, opening a wider path to your business goals.\n\nIf LWC Salesforce fits what you have in mind for your company, just\n\ndrop us a line\n\n.

    "content": "Modular architecture is a revolutionary programming approach\n\nthat gets more done – on budget and on quality. Find out what it is and why it matters.\n\nEver since Henry Ford built the first Model T in 1913, managers, consultants, researchers and workers have been looking for ways of replicating that same logic elsewhere. Over 100 years later, coders are turning vision to reality, by reinterpreting the assembly line concept to their unique programming needs. The result is a leaner approach to IT projects, with shorter lead times and less tech debt. This is what modular architecture actually means for projects and why it matters. What we will cover:\n\nWhat is a modular architecture?\n\nWhy is modular architecture important\n\nBest practices for modular architecture\n\nWhat is a modular architecture?\n\nSay you were building a car. What does the final assembly line look like? Bolts and screws or doors and bumpers?\n\nFor reasons of space and speed, assembly line workers have “modules” or pre-built “kits” at their disposal, which can be quickly and efficiently assembled on the car chassis. This saves time in fixing, adjusting and testing individual items. The modular architecture approach to coding works in a similar way.\n\nUnder it, coders have pre-assembled, and pre-tested modules (the car doors) at their disposal, rather than isolated scripts (the bolts), to build a final product. Each building block, which can be composed of several scripts, contains all the parts necessary to perform a designated task. Then, blocks are stacked together to create an application.\n\nFor Lego fans, same as car buffs, analogies are readily available. It is not so much as building a Lego from different blocks, but more like building a Lego city from different sets.\n\nWhy is modular architecture important\n\nTechnology is constantly evolving, with new features added all the time. Such fast-paced evolution increases testing needs, reducing developers’ productivity. On the other hand, customers’ demand for innovation is ever growing. Thus, developers need a faster way to develop applications. Modular architecture is the answer, with many advantages over traditional methods.\n\nGreater scalability\n\nManaging applications at scale becomes a challenge when additional needs arise and when it is necessary to update or add complementary features. With modular architecture, it is possible to separate the project into smaller modules and allocate developers only to the module where the problem was detected. As such, managers can allocate coders to specific modules, increasing accountability and productivity.\n\nEase of maintenance\n\nDetecting and resolving errors is a hassle, even to well-trained teams. Module architecture makes fixing issues faster and more agile, because erros are limited to certain modules. Thus, it is no longer necessary to analyse every file, and changes to a particular module will not affect the others. The same happens every time a change or update is made to a single module. Rather than retesting the entire application, only the affected areas need to be revised.\n\nReusable code\n\nIn modular architecture, code is written in modules that work independently of each other. This means that coders can use them in different applications, simply by importing them to other projects. Thus, the work that is done once can be reused countless times, which exponentially increases the productivity of any developer.\n\nBest practices for modular architecture\n\nCreating an application using modular architecture starts with dividing the various features into separate modules. This division can be done by resource or by layer, and the choice depends on the team and the project scope.\n\nLand on resource or layer based\n\nmodular architecture\n\nUnder the\n\nresource-based modular architecture approach\n\n, code modules are created according to each application resource. Each module defines a unique feature, which can be integrated into multiple applications and a change in one does not affect the others. It is the ideal approach when the project is large-scaled or when the team is composed of many elements.\n\nIn\n\nmodular architecture based on layers\n\n, however, the application is separated into layers, such as data, domains or presentations, which are then transformed into modules. Thus, there are fewer isolated modules, with more flexible rules.\n\nKeep a clean code\n\nWhichever approach is chosen, it is important to know in depth the characteristics and needs of each project before moving on to the development phase. Also, it is critical to keep the code simple, without duplication or redundancies. Code will then be easier to read, understand and maintain over time, increasing its potential for reuse and scalability.\n\nBe obvious when naming modules\n\nThere are many occasions when creativity is essential– naming modules, however, is not one of them. Give your modules names that are easy to understand. When the project involves multiple modules, you might be tempted not to think about names and mix them up – but assigning a clear, easy-to-understand naming logic will save you time and stress. That way, any developer will know everything about a code just by reading its name.\n\nBuild for openness and avoid tech lock-in\n\nTo foster modularity in your business, choose open source and certified technologies – more likely to be accepted by other apps and partners. Also, enhance integration with APIs as a communication tool, and a module book or catalogue, to be enriched and updated. Avoid technological or business lock‑in, by identifying solutions that make it easy to switch providers. Finally, implement practices to accelerate software development, such as\n\nAgile\n\n,\n\nlow-code\n\n, and DevOps.\n\nNear Partner, building modular architecture\n\nModular architecture is shaping up to be the future of application development. With nodular architecture, there’s no need to reinvent the wheel every time you create an application – the modules already exist and are  waiting to be perfectly integrated and combined to create a new product.\n\nThe Near Partner developer community has already adopted this approach. We apply this and many other best  development practices. Get in touch with Near Partner and let’s get your website or app up and running.",

    "content": "Companies and workers have rediscovered the hybrid workplace with Pandemic.\n\nHow does Near Partner experience a hybrid work model and how does it impact our team?\n\nWhen Apple’s CEO Tim Cook asked corporate staff to return to the office, he probably did not expect any significant backlash. Employees soon made it very clear that it was either the flexible-way or the highway. After months of negotiation, the tech giant finally landed on a three-day on-site policy. However, according to\n\nTopia’s 2022 Adapt Survey\n\n, 82% of companies have a remote work policy in place, and on the surface, this sounds encouraging.\n\nWhat is a hybrid workplace model?\n\nThe hybrid workplace model combines face-to-face with remote work, giving employees the autonomy to choose where, when, and how to work, in order to increase their productivity and engagement.\n\nWorkplace Models\n\nHybrid workplaces are an ecosystem of employees who work from home, in coworking spaces, in cafes, on commute, waiting to board a plane, and also in the office. It is therefore possible to switch between various locations depending on the work that needs to be carried out, while maintaining personal interactions, which are crucial for the company’s culture.\n\nSome say such hybrid arrangements are a stepping stone for something “steady”. Others believe that we are moving towards a Virtual Reality future, where you can put on a headset and collaborate virtually with your teammates. And there are those who argue we will all be going back to the office soon enough.\n\nOne thing is certain: nothing will ever be the same again – and that can be very positive. Companies need to provide the right collaborative tools for employees who work remotely, allowing maximum productivity without sacrificing personal time and quality of life.\n\nHere at Near Partner we have long been working using a Hybrid model approach. We thought it was time to share o\n\nur\n\napproach to hybrid work and the pros and cons as we see them.\n\nOur experience about hybrid workplace model\n\nAt Near Partner, we are neither 100% or 100% office-based. There is no rule saying you have to come in to the office everyday or every two days – we come in whenever we want. This means some people work at the office everyday and others almost never stop by. And that’s perfectly fine, because in the recruitment process, we strive to hire those who can self-motivate.\n\nRelated to the hybrid work reality, we decided to adopt some practices:\n\nHiring process:\n\naround 70% of our recruitment process is online. At the last step of the recruitment process, we invite the candidate to go to our office. The main goal is to meet the “resident team” in the office\n\n?\n\nand tick the final box in the hiring process, a meeting with Pedro Veloso, our CEO.\n\nTraining and Certifications\n\n: we cherish personal and professional growth. We have learning programs, such as online language courses, and total freedom to reserve time to study for technical certifications. Our most recent hiring was Luís Silva, the coach responsible for Near Partner’s Talent Development. What a ride it has been!\n\nHybrid meetings:\n\nevery Friday, we save 30 min to speak about random topics and once a month we replace this meeting with topics related to our organization, our all-hands meeting – Conversa de Pufes. These meetings take place in our office, but are streamed online for those at a distance.\n\nCommunications process:\n\nour internal communication channels ensure whoever can’t be physically present knows what happens in their organization.\n\nInternal events:\n\nSports Sessions, Games Nights and other events are part of our annual agenda and culture.\n\nOur main goal is to have fun and create engaging moments to connect with each other.\n\nSo, can the hybrid workplace model really be the future of work?\n\nWe believe the hybrid workplace model is here to stay. This is why.\n\nEmployees consider it more productive, and they are more satisfied\n\nAccording to a recent\n\nGartner report\n\n, in conventional face-to-face workplaces, where employees work 40 hours a week in the office, only 36% of personnel are top performers. When companies switch to a hybrid working model, that percentage leaps to 55%.\n\nAn approach that puts people first makes companies more flexible, agile, and effective. Employees can work using their own timing and methods that\n\ndrive higher productivity by avoiding distractions and getting work done when they are more efficient\n\n. For example, some people work better in the morning, while others perform better in the evening.\n\nThis is type of autonomy is critical for\n\nemployee satisfaction\n\n. It means each person can decide when and where to work. Statistics support this view:\n\nengaged employees can lead to a 23% increase in a company’s profit\n\n.\n\nIt is possible to hire talent from anywhere in the world (and reduce costs)\n\nHybrid work removes geographic limitations in the hiring process, so you won’t have to rely on employees who live close to the office. In fact, you can have access to a wider range of possibilities across the world, which means a vast talent pool.\n\nRemote work may benefit workers with a disability or chronic illness by allowing them to better contribute to company processes.\n\nSo, hybrid work can add a competitive edge to your company, to your tech team, and even help you enter new markets.\n\nTrue work life balance\n\nWork life balance. Source:\n\nHR Dive\n\nDoes a hybrid workplace have limitations?\n\nYes,\n\nhybrid work can have some disadvantages\n\n. People are all different, so it is important to observe the effects of this method on the team to understand if everyone is benefiting from the hybrid workplace model. These are some of the most common challenges.\n\nLimited relationships and isolation\n\nWith the hybrid work, it is harder to foster organic interpersonal relationships with co-workers. The reduction of face-to-face contact can lead to relational difficulties. These disadvantages may only set in at a later stage, so it is important to ensure that employees do not feel isolated or invisible, keeping them connected and involved, through non-physical environments and technological tools.\n\nWeakened communication\n\nThere is also a risk of communication becoming misaligned, especially when much of the “talking” becomes non-verbal. For example, the same email can be interpreted in different ways, depending on the mood and expectations of the person reading it, as it lacks important non-verbal clues that confirm or disprove the communication.\n\nThis phenomenon happens even in online meetings, when participants adopt a less spontaneous and more formal posture. Therefore, it is important to communicate as clearly as possible, humanize interactions and clarify expectations, in order to reduce the likelihood of wrong assumptions.\n\nCybersecurity risks\n\nIt is common for hybrid employees to use unsecured internet connections. This can create more cybersecurity vulnerabilities, being more sensitive to\n\nhacker or phishing attacks\n\n. Therefore, it is important that companies have technologies with high security standards, and that the entire team is aware of good cybersecurity practices.\n\nA work in progress we’re proud of\n\nRemote work will continue to be a topic as hybrid work is driving business transformation. We believe that distributed teams should be considering their daily work based on the 3 Cs (collaboration, connection, and culture and we will speak about that next time).\n\nIn the last two years, the job market has changed significantly, and our approach to hybrid work has allowed to navigate those changes with all the advantages of working remotely and working in the office, but without many of its obligations.\n\nWe believe that everyone is responsible, committed, and professional no matter from where and how they work.\n\nFor us at Near Partner, the bottom line is that people need freedom to manage their own time. In job interviews, we often share that “with freedom comes responsibility” – our own twist on that memorable Spider Man quote. However, this can be quite challenging when there is not much face-to-face contact but autonomy must be guided by mutual appreciation and positive assumptions.",

    "content": "QA Automation, also known as Test Automation, describes the use of a different piece\n\nof software to\n\nperform\n\ntests on the software that is being developed.\n\nWhat is QA Automation?\n\nEvery piece of software needs rigorous testing before it can hit the market. Despite the best coding practices, bugs or defects always find their way into finished software products.\n\nQA Automation (or Quality Assurance Automation) refers to using specialized and automated tools to run tests on and report results through predefined actions. This testing technique compares the actual outcome with the expected one, to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, user experience issues and other glitches that only come out in specific use cases.\n\nTo achieve this, testing engineers create QA Automation scripts or use any automation testing tools. While Manual Testing is performed by a human Interacting directly with the software.\n\nWhy use QA Automation?\n\nA few advantages of automated software testing include reduced test effort, cost, and time, improved product quality, promote better resource utilization, and suitability for CI/CD.\n\nTo assure quality, someone must run repeatedly software tests on all supported hardware combinations and hardware configurations, during development cycles or whenever source code is updated. The manual repetition of these tests is expensive and time-consuming. Automated tests can be done repeatedly without additional expense, and they can easily include the execution of hundreds of distinct complicated test cases, giving test coverage that is not achievable with manual tests. Automated software testing can execute tests more methodically with less human error and reduce the time required to perform repetitive tests from days to hours.\n\nWhen automated software is shared between testers and developers, issues can be found quickly before the software is sent to quality assurance. When source code changes are checked in, tests can automatically run and notify the team or the developer if they fail. These kinds of features provide developers with more confidence while saving them time.\n\nSo why doesn’t everyone use it?\n\nWhat are the limitations of QA Automation?\n\nSome of the challenges of QA automation are Human dependency, Initial setup costs, selecting the right tool and Inefficient team collaboration.\n\nDespite all its advantages, designing and configuring an automated test framework can be difficult for product companies. Frameworks for test automation have a high initial setup cost and are challenging to maintain.\n\nCompanies also need testing professionals with knowledge of testing tools and programming languages. Additionally, it can be challenging to select the best tool considering the number of automated testing solutions on the market,. Not every automation tool is adaptable to operate with your software architecture or applications.\n\nHowever, these challenges can be successfully addressed as you rely on a solid and highly qualified partner. By doing so, the benefits of QA Automation can be outstanding.\n\nBreak new ground in QA Automation with Near Partner\n\nOverall, QA Automation can save you time and money by speeding up a project while still delivering a high-quality product. It also frees up your team for more advanced assignments, enabling you to grow and expand.\n\nAt Near Partner, our experts are ready to execute it for maximum effect. So, if you need to assess your software’s stability under ordinary and extreme conditions, turn to Near Partner for QA Automation.\n\nGet in touch!",

    "content": "Complaints about delayed or inaccurate shipments are not what stock managers want to hear every day. However, these pain points are bound to happen as customers increase their expectations, supply chains become longer and more complex, and capital costs rise to uncharted levels. A Warehouse Management System can get you through these hurdles, but there is a catch: actually picking one. Here are 5 key factors to consider to choose the right WMS for your business. Here is what you will learn:\n\nWhat is a Warehouse Management System?\n\n5 key features every Warehouse Management System should have\n\nWhat is a Warehouse Management System?\n\nA Warehouse Management System (WMS) is a software solution that tracks materials and goods as they come in and go out of the warehouse. It is widely used in the manufacturing and retail industries, to provide visibility into the entire inventory and manage supply chains, from the distribution centre to the store shelf.\n\nSource:\n\nNetsuite\n\nThese systems are specifically designed to support the needs of a large supply chain. When properly tailored to the needs of the company, they maximize labour, space utilization and equipment investments. WMS also allows companies to coordinate and optimize resource usage and material flows.\n\nStock management operations are generally invisible to the outside world, but they play a vital behind-the-scenes role. More than 30% of businesses admitted that unavailable stock prevented them from shipping orders on time. On average, warehouse capacity utilization is stagnant at less than 70%, meaning roughly one in every 3 square meters of warehousing is wasted. At the same time, warehouse rental costs reach all-time highs, in particular next to urban centers.\n\nThe right WMS also improves stock\n\ntraceability.\n\nIf something goes wrong with an item, you can easily check what else was in that batch and see if the issue persists. It is also extremely useful for handling incoming and outgoing products – you can scan and register as they come in and when they are shipped, adjusting stock levels appropriately.\n\nOn the other hand, a Warehouse Management System improves the\n\nreliability and accuracy of inventory levels\n\n. Manually writing or inputting data can cause huge problems in your operations, but a WMS makes sure that you see is what you have.\n\nPut simply, WMS streamlines operations. But despite its many advantages and how long they have been in the market, WMS are far from ubiquitous. In fact, most business looking to adopt one or improve their current solution. According to Accenture, three out of every five companies are planning to adopt a Warehouse Management System as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is not hard to see why: picking the right WMS takes time. For starters, it requires browsing through many existing alternatives and weighing the options against building your own custom solution. Whatever the chosen path, these are the 5 key features every WMS should possess.\n\n5 key features every Warehouse Management System should have\n\nWhen choosing the right Warehouse Management Software to manage your operations, look out for these 5 key features.\n\n1. Automation\n\nAutomation\n\nis on top of every Warehouse Management Software requirements list. This feature ensures that warehouse operations run smoothly and actually save time. The software must be able to replace manual tasks, eliminating labour-intensive duties that involve repetitive work and manual data entry and analysis. Therefore, it reduces potential errors and ensures that data is updated and accurate.\n\n2. Tracking and Monitoring\n\nA good Warehouse Management Software is all about tracking and monitoring your goods as they go in and out of stock. With this feature, you can have a clearer visibility of your supply chain, and greater control over warehouse operations. Additionally, it is critical for warehouse space optimization. So, make sure your software offers advanced tracking, and barcode scanning so goods can be found easily when moved.\n\n3. Customization\n\nEvery company has its own needs and demands. Hence, having a customizable Warehouse Management Software makes it easier for you to tailor it according to how you want it to be. Your Warehouse Management Software should reflect your own company, leave room to expand and customize key features such as product variables, manage users, add multiple locations, regions and currencies – to name just a few.\n\n4. Flexibility and Accessibility\n\nChanges keep coming. What wasn’t needed yesterday can become necessary today,\n\nas the COVID-19 pandemic taught us\n\n. At some point, you’ll have to adapt protocols, adjust operations and expand connections. That’s why it is important that your Warehouse Management Software can be can a long-term commitment that grows as your business does. You don’t want it to collapse under pressure. Also make sure that your WMS allows you to manage warehouse operations from any devices from anywhere, to keep things running – on your smartphone, tablet, or laptop.\n\n5. Usability\n\nNot everyone is tech-savvy enough to untangle new technology instinctively.

    "content": "A project’s success depends on its planning and management.\n\nA Product Backlog allows you to do just that if it is used correctly.\n\nA project is about to start, and things are looking hectic already. It’s your cue to create a product backlog. Don’t know where to start? Let’s go through the essentials of this project management tool and how to use it a practical way in your business. Here is what you will learn:\n\nProduct Backlog: the essentials\n\nMain elements of a Product Backlog\n\nHave you decided which Agile framework works best for you? Backlog management is quite different whether you use Scrum or Kanban. In a glance, Scrum feeds the sprint backlog at the start of the sprint, choosing the work that will be performed during the sprint. On the other hand, there are no sprints in Kanban, as it continuously feeds the board according to the team’s progress. In our\n\nprevious article about Scrum vs Kanban\n\n, we explain the differences between these two frameworks.\n\nProduct Backlog: the essentials\n\nMuch like a product roadmap or to-do list, a product backlog tells development teams what they need to do and when. But unlike mo\n\nst\n\nto-do lists or roadmaps, product backlogs are not static. Quite the opposite: product backlogs are designed to manage change and need to be dynamic enough to tackle even the most unexpected scope creep.\n\nA Product Owner (PO) must be able to order Product Backlog items by different criteria, such as priority, value, ROI, urgency, dependencies, or any combination of these. Whatever the case, a clear and well-ordered backlog delivers the most important items first, leading to more focus. Besides, ordering the backlog is not a one-time event. Priorities need to be reviewed regularly, as new information comes in.\n\nMain elements of a Product Backlog\n\nSo, what exactly makes product backlogs so effective in managing complexity? It typically includes the following elements.\n\nFeatures\n\nProduct features are the key functionalities, basically everything you want your product to do. Features are also commonly formulated as epics\n\n,\n\ndivided into smaller user stories. A user’s ability to create an account, for instance, would be an epic in a Product Backlog. To do that, you will need to setup several user stories such as the log in page, the retrieve password option, etc. A product backlog can include planned or unplanned features, new ideas, improvements on existing features or requests from users. This helps developers keep track of multiple steps or components, like front-end or back-end tasks, or tests that need to be completed.\n\nBugs\n\nBugs are often excluded from the product backlog and dealt with separately. However, whatever defects, performance problems or broken functionalities are encountered, they should be included in the backlog, as well as bug fixes. Why? Because including bugs and defects in the backlog will help, for example, decide what to prioritise (is the bug a priority over a certain feature?), estimate timelines and workloads, and keep technical debt under control.\n\nTechnical debt\n\nSpeaking of technical debt, product backlogs are a great tool to deal with an array of these issues. Be it because of a bug discovered a bit too late, because of the need for refactoring a big chunk of code to improve a feature, or even because of external factors (framework related, for instance),\n\ntechnical debt is a reality that needs to be managed, not hidden\n\n. The problem isn’t having technical debt, but not documenting it properly to keep it from resurfacing and not dealing with it. Do you know\n\nthe true cost of technical debt\n\n, if pushed to the side?\n\nKnowledge Acquisition\n\nAnd finally, as you create and add features, discover bugs and defects, deal with technical debt, and fix bugs and defects, you will most likely gain some knowledge. This knowledge, technical or not, will provide information for future tasks. For example, during the project, your team identifies a feature that needs more work. However, this work is not straightforward and there is a need for some research. Then, this is the time to create a knowledge acquisition task. These can be prototypes, experiments, techniques and approaches,\n\nproof-of-concept\n\n, tests… These should also go into the product backlog, albeit clearly identified from other tasks.\n\nAdvantages of using a Product Backlog\n\nUsing a product backlog allows the development team to prioritize software development tasks, meaning dev teams will manage their time and work better, thus increasing efficiency of the team and the work they do.\n\nA product backlog also allows teams to cooperate and communicate better and more efficiently, since everyone involved in the project’s development—not only the software dev team — can contribute to it, for example, with feature requests. Having a place to summarise and concentrate all the relevant info on the project facilitates discussions and helps decision making. Streamlined communication within and between teams also aligns expectations. By providing a global view of the project’s status, product backlogs allow teams to work more cohesively towards a common goal.\n\nIn short, a product backlog integrates inputs from different sources (dev team, sales team, end-users, marketing sales, stakeholders) in one place and outputs an organised stream of features requests, bugs, tech debt or knowledge acquisition, all the while breaking the work that needs to be done into smaller, manageable chunks. For all these reasons, good product backlog management can be particularly critical to\n\nextended or remote teams\n\n, where coordination and clear communication are essential to prevent\n\ntech debts\n\nand delivery high-end results.\n\nCreating a Product Backlog\n\nFirst, to create a product backlog, there needs to be a clear owner of the backlog, which can be the Product Owner. This assigned person is a key stakeholder in the project as he will have a very strategic role of representing the interests of the customer for the development team, or a user advocate. It is his responsibility to oversee the product backlog and ensure it is organised and accessible to the teams working on it.\n\nSecond, by having a clear, defined product roadmap and product requirements, product owners can prepare the following information in collaboration with the development team and various stakeholders such as Subject Matter Experts (SME) or Architects.\n\nList the first essential (high priority) items on your backlog;\n\nLet other stakeholders add ideas or suggestions (even if abstract) to the backlog;\n\nLet the relevant teams pitch in and start prioritising the items;\n\nIdentify possible roadblocks and prioritise them along with other items;\n\nKeep refining and updating the backlog as you go, considering the team’s inputs as well as those provided by external stakeholders, whenever needed.\n\nAs you add complexity (items, requirements), product backlogs will start shaping up and becoming more useful. And, obviously, the more experience you have, the better, more organised, easier to visualise and follow your product backlog will be.\n\nNeed a hand with your Product Backlog?\n\nWhile a product backlog is a wonderful artifact to streamline product development and management, it can be hard to get started. Fortunately, at Near Partner we are very used to product backlogs – it has been our standard practise for years – so we can absolutely lend you a hand (or a set of hands) with that.\n\nTake a look at the\n\nsolutions\n\nwe offer or just get in touch if you are unsure of how we can help your business.\n\nGet in touch\n\nwith Near Partner and get your project up and running.",

    "content": "A simple error in a dataset can have a devastating effect on a company.\n\nThis is how to fend off threats, secu\n\nre your information,\n\nand maintain data integrity.\n\nBroken dashboards, poorly trained Machine Learning models, inaccurate analytics. Clean and reliable data is a challenge for any information intensive company.\n\nThere is little doubt that data is vital, either to outperform competitors, acquire new customers, and become more efficient. So why is so little care given to its “hygiene”? The cold fact is data breaks and data downtime can have dire consequences for any businesses .This is what data integrity is in practical terms and how it can help companies.\n\nWhat you will learn:\n\nWhat is Data Integrity?\n\nHow important is it to maintain Data Integrity?\n\nWhat are the threats to Data Integrity?\n\nHow to check Data Integrity in 6 simple steps\n\nGetting started with Data Integrity\n\nWhat is Data Integrity?\n\nData Integrity is the guarantee that digital information is not corrupted, altered, or lost, and that it is accessed or modified by authorized persons. In other words, it shows whether data remains valid, accurate, and reliable throughout its life cycle.\n\nSo what is a “healthy” dataset? How can you know if the data has been compromised? For Data Integrity to be assured, it must first be complete, meaning no data should be filtered or lost. Second, it needs accuracy: no data should undergo any qualitative change that compromises its analysis. Consistency is also key.\n\nData must remain the same, regardless of how or how many times it is accessed, and for how long it is stored. Finally, and perhaps most obviously, data should be secure at all times. Data must only be accessed by authorized applications or persons, to avoid malicious and criminal uses.\n\nHow important is it to maintain Data Integrity?\n\nData has become an essential part of every area of a company, from sales to marketing, production or logistics, finance or accounting. Accurate and timely data allows companies to monitor performance, identify patterns, and outline\n\nimprovement opportunities\n\n. From this starting point, it is possible to design customized strategies that bring measurable financial returns. Thus, missing or inaccurate data can cause poor business decisions, with damaging consequences for a company’s goals. After all, the quality of a decision is only as good as the information fed to the decision maker.\n\nUnfortunately, no industry is immune to “bad” data and organizations struggle because they lack confidence in the information that is supposed to guide their day-to-day decisions. Bad data is any piece of information that is erroneous, missing, outdated, duplicate, injured, misleading, or confusing in its format. In short, bad data is simply data that isn’t useful and prevents your data collection efforts from paying off.\n\nBesides informing corporate decisions, data integrity is also essential for protecting sensitive information. From customer data, to process parameters, or an upcoming product launch details, data integrity ensures every bit of information is secured. If not well protected, it can be exposed, tampered with, or even deleted. So what exactluy causes bad data.\n\nWhat are the threats to Data Integrity?\n\nFrom human error to malicious actions, there are several threats that can compromise data integrity.\n\nHuman error\n\nAny human activity involves, by nature, some degree of error. Thus, when several people access the same dataset, whether to add, transfer or delete data, there is bound to be a data integrity risk.\n\nHardware failures\n\nRemember that\n\nmassive global outage at Meta\n\nthat left Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp offline for at least five hours? As it turns out,\n\ndatacenter outages are becoming longer\n\nand more expensive. The gap between the beginning of a major outage and full recovery has stretched significantly over the last five years, with nearly 30% of these outages in 2021 lasted more than 24 hours. Downtime is also becoming more expensive, with more than 60% of failures resulting in at least $100,000 in total losses.\n\nSource:\n\nuptime institute\n\nThis type of failure can limit or eliminate access to data. Businesses will be best able to meet the challenge with rigorous staff training and operational procedures to mitigate the human error behind many of these failures.\n\nMalicious actions\n\nHackers can exploit a fragile infrastructure to steal, alter or destroy data. In addition, a network with low security can open doors to external criminal actions, which are becoming more and more sophisticated. Bugs, spyware, malware, and other viruses that infect systems and take over information can compromise data. Cyber-attacks are growing, both in quantity and complexity, so the danger has never been more real.\n\nMultiple data sources\n\nCRM, ERP,\n\nBusiness Intelligence\n\n, social media, email, custom web apps – the world of data is more diverse than ever before, with data sets flowing in and out of any system at lightning speed. For developers, it means data is getting more diverse and complex, both in terms of structure and content. Managing such diversity is hard and, without proper care, can lead Data Integrity efforts to falter.\n\nHow to check Data Integrity in 6 simple steps\n\nData integrity is not a simple concept and cannot be guaranteed by isolated actions. It involves several people, processes, rules, and tools to ensure a satisfactory level of protection. These are some preventive strategies that can help build a safer environment.\n\n1. Validate data entries\n\nData entry validation guarantees that the new incoming information is correct. For example, when users fill in online forms, it is important to have field validation mechanisms, ensuring that an email is entered correctly or that a letter is not entered in a field intended for the phone number. Such checks have long been in place, but many companies are taking this even further by using AI to cross check new data against the existing dataset. These systems alert users when, for instance, a price entered is higher than the expected amount or when the amount ordered is much lower than usual.\n\n2. Remove duplicate data\n\nIt is prudent to identify locations where sensitive data may be repeated. For example, bank details can be stored in several locations, which multiplies the possibility of being accessed by unauthorized persons. To ensure data integrity, it is vital to establish a process on how to signal and evaluate possible duplicates. For instance, some companies frequently ask customers to confirm their contact data, to ensure current information is updated.\n\n3. Increase backup frequency\n\nConfirm the frequency of your backup system. Make sure that it is set as often as possible. Some systems, by default, assume an intermediate frequency, but this change can make a difference in a ransomware attack. When backups are activated, the risk for data integrity is an even higher, as it can be hard to match the latest versions of the system against the backup version.\n\n4. Control access\n\nMost Data Integrity issues boil down to human error. As such, data access and role assignment should be properly managed. Who gets to do, see, edit, and delete which bits of data? Physical access to the server should not be overlooked either – the most sensitive servers should be kept isolated. Also, it is important to use logs to track when data is accessed or changed.\n\n5. Implement a prevention policy\n\nIt is important that everyone be aware of the importance of data integrity. The joint effort results in more effective preventive actions, as everyone is better prepared to identify potential threats and act preventively.\n\n6. Use data integrity tools\n\nThere are plenty of tools to help identify patterns and relationships between data sets, and setting up automated processes to keep data updated and synchronized. Data quality assessment tools, for instance, help identify errors, and determine if data is complete and accurate. Data cleansing tools help clean up data, remove duplicates, and standardize data format. Mining tools identify patterns and trends in data. Finally, data visualization tools create graphical representations of data that can identify errors, trends, and outliers.\n\nGetting started with Data Integrity\n\nIt’s more important than ever to trust your data. The future of your organization depends on it. However, protecting the integrity of your company’s data can seem like an overwhelming task. After years in the field, our superstar developers at\n\nNear Partner\n\nbecame experts in Data Integrity. We would love to brainstorm and help you design a path to secure your information.\n\nDrop us a message\n\nand let’s make sure that your data is safe and sound!",

    "content": "Extreme programming is reshaping how dev teams get things done.\n\nFind out what it is, what the benefits are and why it might not work.\n\nQuestion: what is the fastest way to create any piece of software? Answer: Extreme programming. Catch: it requires making some tough choices and developing only the bare minimum to make it work. If coding is a race (isn’t it?), extreme programming delivers winners – even if they do not look the part. Welcome to a world where tech specs rule, function trumps form and shaving seconds off coding is an art form. This is what extreme programming means and how it can help businesses. What are we going to dive into?\n\nWhat is extreme programming?\n\nWhat are the benefits of extreme programming?\n\nWhat are the risks of extreme programming?\n\nExtreme programming: key practices you need to explore for your team\n\nNear Partner, achieving extreme results\n\nWhat is extreme programming?\n\nFrom the outside, extreme programming, or XP, looks like any\n\nagile software development methodology\n\n. It shares all the agile principles including iterative structure of projects, customer involvement, and intense communication inside the teams. XP even has the same generic goal as most agile approaches: achieve the shortest iterative development cycles, reducing time-to-market. So why all the buzz?\n\nExtreme programming differs from traditional methodologies because it embraces change rather than following rigid, cascading plans. Instead of a big planning phase at the start of a project, extreme programming schedules smaller and more frequent plannings events at the beginning of each work cycle. The core principle is to test code as frequently and as early as possible. Sounds simple enough, right?\n\nWhat is extreme programming? Source:\n\nDigite\n\nBut what truly makes extreme programming unique is its laser-focus on the technical aspects of software development. XP’s bare-bones logic requires focusing only on the key essential tech specs – and pushing everything else aside. It is a no-thrills approach to coding, similar to what low-cost aviation has achieved, where aesthetics or UX/UI are secondary to the main mission – get to where you need to be in the shortest possible time frame.\n\nThat makes XP particularly suitable for projects with dynamically changing software requirements or new technologies. It is also a great way to manage a small development team – or break up larger teams into smaller units. To achieve the goal of creating fast, continuous and incremental delivery cycles, extreme programming implies closer and more frequent interaction with customers, constant testing and revisions – which brings advantages, but also some challenges.\n\nWhat are the benefits of extreme programming?\n\nThe biggest advantage is that this methodology saves time and costs throughout the project. Everything non-essential and non-productive is eliminated to reduce expenses and frustration, with a greater focus on coding and testing.\n\nIn addition, extreme programming reduces the probability of errors, since it implies carrying out tests with greater frequency. This feature also increases the readability of the code and facilitates future maintenance. Continuous communication and feedback between the team and the client reduces gaps in the processes. The final product can thus reach a high level of quality, because of the number of tests carried out, the precision of the development and the quick resolution of eventual errors.\n\nExtreme programming is also highly adaptable, which allows work to adjust to unexpected customer requests or sudden requirements changes. Clients get exactly what they want and the team moves in the right direction, with lower levels of stress and frustration.\n\nWhat are the risks of extreme programming?\n\nDespite the undeniable advantages, there are some cases where extreme programming may not be the best solution. First, extreme programming focuses on code rather than design, which, for some, can be a disadvantage. When design gets pushed aside, the final product can leave the customer dissatisfied and it can be harder to imagine what the final product will look like.\n\nSecond, extreme programming may not be the best option if the\n\nteam works remotely\n\n, or if customers are geographically far away. Working together, close collaboration, and face-to-face interaction are the main pillars of extreme programming. When programmers work far away from each other or in different time-zones, and when it is not possible to have frequent and close meetings with the customer, implementing it can be difficult or downright impossible. Still, there are a few key best practices to consider when trying out.\n\nExtreme programming: key practices you need to explore for your team\n\nImplementing it represents a major paradigm shift in any company’s culture.\n\n1. Pair programming\n\nThis is one of the main features. With XP, at least two programmers work side by side to develop code together. At first, this may seem like an increase in overhead and cost, but it is the way to ensure maximum quality. In this regard, a careful selection of partners is necessary so that the process is carried out with maximum efficiency.\n\n2. Small teams\n\nIt is recommended that teams working in extreme programming have between 4 and 8 elements, although more experienced teams can be effective with a greater number of programmers. The minimum of 4 is a way to ensure enough diverse expertise to cover all project needs.\n\n3. Ongoing processes\n\nPlanning should consider that the code must be integrated and released at a high rate – a principle also advocated by the “DevOps” movement. This allows the product to be permanently evaluated, so that problems are resolved as soon as possible, which leads to superior quality.\n\n4. Encoding standards\n\nTeams must develop code according to a common set of rules, previously defined and agreed by everyone. Encoding standards assure the product is more consistent,\n\navoid technical debt\n\nand keep maintenance efforts to a minimum.\n\nNear Partner, achieving extreme results\n\nExtreme programming is an effective tool – if you know how and when to use it. It can drive the results that customers are looking for, making it possible to achieve efficiency and permanent adaptation to change and new ideas. But it can also make it harder for the user to imagine and validate the end product. It may or may not be suitable for your particular project – so why take the chance? Get in touch with our team so we can dive into your needs and define the best approach. We keep clients super involved, like true partners, keeping their goals at the heart of the process.",

    "content": "A small part of a business’ tech debt is inevitable, but what about the rest?\n\nThis is how expensive tech debt really is.\n\nTech debt or technical debt\n\nrefers to the cost of having to rework\n\nfaulty or poor-quality software. It is expensive, demotivating, grinding work. It is also, for the most part, avoidable.\n\nTech debt: the house developers built\n\nWith software upgrades and the natural evolution of legacy systems, there’s always going to be the need to revisit and rewrite code or software.\n\nSome technical debt is, in fact, unavoidable, but this kind of tech debt isn’t the burden we’re talking about.\n\nLet’s make a parallel with becoming a homeowner. Becoming a homeowner is exciting and saves money in the long run, compared to renting. However, the expenses of owning a house do not end when the house is paid off. In fact, they never end. Houses need maintenance and upkeep every few years, forever. Be it replacing the caulking around windows and doors to keep your home insulated, sealing the grout in bathrooms and kitchens to ensure no water infiltrations, there are inevitable costs. The same goes for software developing and tech debt.\n\nHowever, there are other expenses associated with a house that are not part of normal upkeep. We’re talking, mainly, fixing the “shortcuts” taken when building the house. These include things like replacing bad quality windows, upgrading boilers, fixing structural insulation issues, or others that normally result from a “fast” or “cheap” job. While these decisions may help cut corners and\n\nget software to market faster\n\n, they often end up costing more overall.\n\nCalculating the true cost of tech debt\n\nTech debt, just like any kind of debt, increases over time–call it interest. And, just like any other debt, it indirectly affects other departments and areas of your business.\n\nEngineering time\n\nAccording to a\n\n2022 study\n\n, “technical debt is estimated to waste up to 42% of developers’ time. At the same time, there is a global shortage of software developers, meaning that developer productivity is key to software businesses”. That means that more than one third of their pay is being “used” on fixing mistakes. Besides the cost in salaries, tech debt keeps engineers from achieving its full potential, and depletes motivation.\n\nMaintenance\n\nWhat normally happens when there is a lot of tech debt is that companies choose to allocate a team to perform maintenance. Instead, they should focus on getting rid of tech debt backlog as much as possible and keep from generating even more. But the decision to put maintenance over addressing tech debt’s root cause comes with a cost. Do you know\n\nhow much a dream team costs\n\n?\n\nSupport\n\nThere is also the case of your current team not being able to deal with the problems that caused, or are causing, tech debt. Often this leads to bugs that QA staff doesn’t detect in time but are spotted by the users, your customers, themselves. So, you will have increased support costs, be it customer support, or emergency backend support to fix the bug(s) quickly.\n\nLegal & Compliance\n\nWhile this isn’t the case for all businesses, tech debt can cause legal costs – fines, compliance penalties or even lawsuits. And when this happens, the consequences can seriously harm a business. When software is riddled with tech debt, for example, issues that need updating or changing. And the longer it takes to apply changes, the deeper developers will need to dig to improve poorly written code and fix “quick fixes”. Which, in turn, increases the chances of non-compliance.\n\nDelayed product releases\n\nAround 66% of engineers believe their team would be up to 100% faster\n\nif there was a process in place for dealing with technical debt. Tech debt can delay the launch of stable releases, causing your product to become obsolete in the market. Even in a “best-case scenario”, a delay of just a couple months in shipping can have important effects on revenue.\n\nSource:\n\nStepsize (2021)\n\nDo you know how\n\nenterprise-grade low-code can speed up time-to-market\n\n?\n\nLost opportunities\n\nImagine this: your business’ budget has to allocate resources (monetary, human, or both) to tech debt, meaning there is a lower budget for other activities–these will have to wait. If you choose to put technical debt in the back burner, to allow your team to focus on other matters, then you’re increasing your tech debt.\n\nLost talent\n\nDoes anyone enjoy having to fix things to work on something? According to a\n\n2021 study\n\n, 52% of engineers say that tech debt negatively impacts their team’s morale. This means less productivity, less efficiency, and a genuine possibility of losing talent, as unhappy engineers and developers will most likely look for more exciting work opportunities.\n\nKeeping the cost of tech debt low\n\nWhen there is a considerable amount of technical debt, the first step is to, well, deal with it. This means you need to allocate resources to technical debt– a team. Second, you need a process in place to help you avoid future technical debt. This can quickly become overwhelming for businesses of all sizes. Teams might not have enough capacity to deal with it and still put in work in the rest, or not have the skills to revisit copious amount of faulty code or complicated legacy systems. Ever considered an\n\nextended team\n\n?\n\nAt Near Partner, we’re a\n\ngrowing team of developers\n\nwith several areas of expertise, and we’re ready to collaborate with you and get the best solutions for your business. Still unsure about what route to take. Let us help you find the right path for your company and create a solid strategy for dealing with tech debt:\n\nget in touch\n\n!",

And the benefits do not end there.\n\nThe benefits of a logistics app\n\nFrom production to delivery, there are numerous people and processes involved in every material flow in companies of all sizes. A logistics app is essential to eliminate errors and to tighten control over operations. These are the most important advantages:\n\nAchieve a more effective team integration.\n\nControl inventory and stock in the warehouse and ensure efficient tracking in real-time\n\nReduce the cost of labour that would be required for manual control, subject to natural human errors.\n\nStreamline communication and coordination\n\n, including automatic warnings and alerts to those involved in the operation.\n\nDecrease avoidable expenses with errors and waste along the logistics chain, especially in the food and perishable products sector, as well as in the return and reshipment of goods.\n\nSupport business decisions with reliable data and information.\n\nThe question is not whether to have a logistics app, but how to procure one that is right for your business or how to go about the project of building or customizing a solution to cater to specific needs. These are the factors to ensure you make the right choice.\n\n8 best practices for a successful logistics app implementation\n\nCreating a cloud-based supply network is an ambitious effort. It requires a structured, disciplined approach. This approach, and the starting point, will be different for every company. Crucially, that is where many companies falter in implementing a logistics app. An off-the-shelf solution may be a great starting point, but it requires expert help to truly unlock the full business value of the cloud. It must adapt to your business and not the other way around. It must be flexible and configurable.\n\n1. Clearly identify the Logistics app business requirements\n\nThe first step is to recognize your company’s current context, pinpoint areas that need improvement and goals you want to achieve. For example, the priorities may lay in team management or in process digitalization. Map out the features you will need, the data and variables you will work with, and the number of users who will access the logistics app, as well as the respective levels of control and editing.\n\n2. Minimize data inputs\n\nMake sure that the logistics app does automatic data compilation. If so, it will no longer be necessary to manually enter information, thereby reducing the number of employees involved in the operation, optimizing working times and increasing productivity. In addition, you can get analysis reports faster.\n\n3. Offline Access\n\nIt is possible that, at some point, the internet connection fails or becomes slower. On the other hand, teams may be on the move, in locations where there may be no network. Thus, it may be important for the logistics app to guarantee remote access in offline mode, in order to carry out activities regardless of external conditions.\n\n4. Communication\n\nThe logistics app must facilitate communication and tasks’ delegation within teams that often operate in different sectors or branches. By exchanging information or managing projects remotely it is possible to achieve\n\ngreater productivity\n\n, meet deadlines and check compliances.\n\n5. Scalability and flexibility\n\nIt’s important to consider whether the logistics app is adaptable enough to grow with your business, so expansion does increase costs. Otherwise, you may need to change the app or rehost it, with significant migration costs and even operational delays.\n\n6. Multi-language support\n\nThis tip is especially important for businesses with branches and warehouses located in different countries or a multilingual workforce. A solid, committed and permanently available support service in several languages is essential to answer operational questions that may arise at any time, as well as unforeseen events.\n\n7. Software integration\n\nCheck if the logistics app integrates with software you already use, in order to get a higher level of data flow. It is essential to synchronize and centralize all information from various sources, such as human resources, accounting, marketing, transport, purchasing, customer management, among others.\n\nBuild your next Logistics app with us\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we have the knowledge, and the methods to help you implement a tailored solution.

    "content": "Enhancing your project management skills can make the difference between\n\na project coming in on time and on budget and being a failure.\n\nIT projects live several lives. With long lifespans, ever-growing scopes and multiple stages to manage, the life of those setting out to tame such a wild beast is bound to be challenging. To do so, you need a “particular set of skills” … like these 8 project management skills. But first, let’s have a look at why IT projects actually fail. Let’s get into it:\n\nOrganizations need IT project management skills, and they need them now\n\n8 project management skills to run IT projects successfully\n\nNear Partner, taking your IT project management to the next level\n\nOrganizations need IT project management skills, and they need them now\n\nA whopping\n\n70% of all projects fail\n\n, for a variety of reasons. The most prevalent ones include lack of planning and management participation, underestimating resources, improper requirements collection and insufficient testing, just to name a few. In fact, the most common project implementation problems occur when everyone goes erratically with the flow and no one is actively sailing the ship.\n\nLet’s take a look at one of the most flagrant examples of poor project management the world has seen. Ever heard of Google Nexus Q? Most likely you haven’t, because it crashed and burned before it even came to market. It consisted of a digital media player, resembling a bowling ball. Nexus Q intended to leverage Google’s online media offerings, such as Google Play Music or YouTube, hence providing a “shared” experience. However, it received\n\nmixed reviews from critics\n\nfollowing its unveiling, such as weird connection issues and lack of functionality. So, the launch never came. The Nexus Q was quietly shelved, and the remaining prototypes were given away for free.\n\nWithout a proper project management, obvious steps are overlooked, projects can turn into disasters, e-graveyards get filled with products and companies write off billions of dollars. And it gets worse: all these problems can come back to haunt you, and clients are not easy forgivers. The good news is that implementing a project management process can\n\nreduce the failure rate to under 20%\n\n. That’s why you need IT project management skills, and you need them now.\n\n8 project management skills to run IT projects successfully\n\nThese are eight essential project management skills you need to succeed and stand out among the competition.\n\n1. Understanding IT architecture and standards\n\nAn IT project manager needs a complete vision of the project and to be familiar with ever evolving IT platforms and methodologies. IT projects are filled with buzzwords and acronyms that can confuse even the most experienced IT staff. So, it’s important to master the underlying language and technical terms, in order to fully grasp how the project can meet the client’s needs.\n\nFor example, if the project involves SSD storage and an in-memory database, the project manager should understand if that means petabytes of storage for “big data” analysis. It is simply a matter of grasping the resources required to get the job done. Fail to do that, and risk dooming the whole project.\n\n2. Communicating to fill in the blanks\n\nFrom kick-offs to stakeholder meetings, project managers are constantly communicating and spend a stupendous\n\n90 percent of their time doing it\n\n. Even if it’s important to get this part of job done it’s not as easy as it may seem. Humans are complex. You have to know how to approach people, how to create meaningful relationships, and articulate a clearly established vision of what you wish to achieve. And there’s more to it: you’ll need to anticipate doubts, misinterpretations, gaps and other unclear issues before they even happen. If it sounds difficult,\n\nLaetitia, one of the latest additions to the Near Partner family\n\n, clarifies: “a project manager is both a facilitator and communicator, ensuring everyone shares the same vision”.\n\nTherefore, take the time to think about what you want to say and how you want to say it, using the same language as your team members and your clients. A good communicator can resolve or prevent almost any issue by being crystal clear and fostering an unconstrained flow of information – delivering the correct data to the right person through the appropriate channel.\n\nAs a project manager, you’ll also need to prevent failures before they happen and reach the customer. Money can be spent in a preventive way, to avoid failures, and is referred as cost of conformance, which can include activities such as process documentation, training, inspections, and audits. Money can also be spent in a reactive way, after failures have happened, in this case referred as cost of non-conformance, including re-work or scrap, or damage to reputation.\n\n3. Negotiating to manage conflicts\n\nLeading a project implies constant negotiating, from managing resources and engaging suppliers, to dealing with team conflicts. Unavoidable arguments about budgets, scope creep, assets and timelines can easily become a nightmare if not managed thoughtfully.\n\nA project manager needs to be a real-world negotiator to encourage solutions toward a unified goal, choosing the most effective one in each given scenario. Some may call for compromise, others for collaboration or competition to meet the needs of all parties. A project manager is a keeper of both good workplace relationships and quality requirements – a tough balancing act for even the savviest professional.\n\n4. Managing costs\n\nThere is more to cost management than overseeing the budget. In fact, project manager often comes across a challenge known as “triple constraint”: cost, time and scope. It is expected that the project manager proposes an estimate of those three boundaries, and this can be quite tricky.\n\nA project manager must walk the tightrope, staying within budget while keeping the timeline on track while delivering (but not overreaching) the initial scope. However, depending on the methodology used in the project, these constraints are managed in a different way. In traditional project management, scope is fixed at the start of a project, whereas time and cost are adjusted to come up with an acceptable plan. On the other side,\n\nAgile\n\nturns the triple constraint upside down: scope is adjusted to focus on the highest priorities when time (iterations) and cost (team members) are fixed.\n\n5. Making tough choices\n\nEspecially valuable project managers have no fear of making difficult, yet well-informed decisions – as part of a team or on their own. In fact, many projects miss their scope, budget or delivery timeline due to unexpected surprises that need to be creatively managed.\n\nTo do so, a project manager must always be on the lookout for risks – a potential issue that may or not happen and can impact the project positively or negatively – and issues – that already occurred. For high-impact risks, mitigation plans are needed, whereas for issues, immediate action is necessary to resolve them.\n\nIt is important to step back and look at the big picture, ask the hard questions, weigh different options, find a creative resolution – and stick to your guns. After all, project manager have the greatest visibility into both the technical and business sides of the project.\n\n6. Influencing to get things done\n\nIt is vital that IT project managers possess the ability to influence others’ decisions and opinions through reason and persuasion. They can set the teams up for success by calling out their strengths and showing them practical ways to improve their weaknesses.\n\nAs reliability is a key skill to effective influencing and persuasion, it turns out essential for a project manager to create an environment of trust and confidence with both the team members and the customer. When the teams feel that they can count on project managers to be competent and honest, they are more likely to be positively influenced.\n\n7. Prioritization to mute out the noise\n\nInformation overload is a very real phenomenon, but our cognitive load is limited. There is a threshold to the amount of data our minds can process. We have limited resources (such as time, employees and capital), many things to do, and not enough time to perform the way we would like to. In\n\nthe words of Laetitia\n\n, “project managers keep things running smoothly by focusing on the deliverables and being mindful of risks and constraints.”\n\nSo, prioritization is essential to figure out where your energy should be focused. Despite all the pings and notifications, a project manager must be able to handle this deluge of information and root out the valuable bits from the noise.\n\n8. Agile thinking\n\nTradition is not what it used to be. Rigid structures are being replaced by clear and responsive iterative processes, such as agile software development. An\n\nagile approach\n\ncan help project managers organize scheduling, even as resource shortages, standards changes, personnel availability, and other unforeseen issues make it difficult to keep up.\n\nAgile project management enables quick adaptation to market or users expectations changes, as well as work acceleration and risk management, equally vital for the project to be successful, and for the team and the client to be pleased with the methods and the final outcome.\n\nNear Partner, taking your IT project management to the next level\n\nThese 8 IT project managements skills are a huge advantage and an invaluable differentiating factor. While the needs may vary dramatically from one project to the next, these cross-cutting skills go a long way toward the success of virtually any project.\n\nOur project managers can help you oversee and deliver IT projects. We have knowledge, technical and business skills, ambition and determination to help. So, let’s grab a chair and talk.\n\nHow can we help\n\n?",

    "content": "QA Engineer plays a fundamental in any IT endeavour.\n\nThis is what they do and why every team should have one.\n\nPoor planning, ambiguous objectives, high expectations, too ambitious deadlines, and an undefined scope. These are only a few of the major reasons why up to\n\n70% of IT initiatives fail.\n\nBut when a team is able to recognize not only the ideal result but the roadblocks that may impede it, it will be better equipped to correct the trajectory of a faltering project. All part of a QA (or Quality Assurance) Engineer’s day. What will you learn?\n\nWhat is a QA Engineer?\n\nWhat are the skills of a QA Engineer?\n\nWhy and when do you need a QA Engineer on your team?\n\nNear Partner, the QA Engineers team you need to evolve\n\nWhat is a QA Engineer?\n\nNobody is perfect, but technology must be. In short, a QA Engineer assures the quality of a project by monitoring each stage of its development. Since requirement validation, test planning, scripting and execution, bug reporting and fix validation.\n\nBesides that, QA Engineers are also responsible for defining the tests that will detect technical flaws, such as the identification of bugs, while suggesting changes so that the product complies with quality standards.\n\nIn practice, Quality Engineers create procedures for programmers to follow, run automated and manual test scripts, implement automated tests and perform compatibility tests with other programs, systems or networks. That is when they are not busy documenting and reporting software bugs or suggesting additional features that minimize problems, making the project more efficient and easier to use.\n\nThus, a QA Engineer has a preventive strategic attitude, searching for contradictory or unclear requirements, anticipating problems to avoid or resolve them more quickly. More than just checking if a product works, they predict what happens if the product is not properly used, if the power fails, if an unauthorized user gains access, or if ten thousand users log in at the same time.\n\nWhat are the skills of a QA Engineer?\n\nA successful QA Engineer adds crucial hard and soft skills to any team. They master\n\nprogramming languages\n\n​​such as HTML,\n\nCSS\n\n, JavaScript, and PHP to help them run automated test scripts. SQL, the most used language to manage databases and structured data, makes it easier for a QA Engineer to understand and query data. This skill also allows clearer and more efficient communication with the development team.\n\nAlso,\n\nAgile testing\n\nallows QA Engineers to foresee issues as early as possible, write and execute test cases, and uncover any gaps. It is essential that QA Engineers divide the project into iterative stages, add focus to the development process, and provide rapid, continuous feedback. Agile QA Engineers deliver working software earlier, anticipate change, provide better estimates, and allow ongoing corrections.\n\nAnd since almost everything is mobile, and mobile development has a particular set of considerations. So, it is essential that a QA Engineer keeps track of the most suitable access technologies for web and mobile devices, in order to plan testing sequences in different environments.\n\nBut there’s more to a QA Engineer than technical skills. Since it is part of their role to mediate managers, customers, and developers, analyse and report problems, it is important that the QA Engineer has\n\ncommunication skills\n\n. By doing so, they prevent interferences and blockages in the project, and ensure\n\nthat the entire team is aligned\n\n.\n\nWhy and when do you need a Qa Engineer on your team?\n\nHaving QA Engineers on your software development team can help ensure successful software projects, from a market as well as technical perspective.\n\nBusiness requirements\n\nA QA Engineer steps in right at the start of the project, when the business requirements are being decided. At this stage, the fundamental question to ask is “What will this feature allow us to do that we can not do yet?” A Quality Engineer then helps to analyse the integration and feasibility of requirements, and assess which solutions work and which don’t. Basically, QA Engineers validate whether the product makes sense for users and the market.\n\nTesting\n\nThe testing strategy is defined by QA Engineers, which includes an estimation of time and effort for each stage of the project. A QA Engineer streamlines the testing process and ensures that it runs quickly and efficiently, without unexpected obstacles and contingencies. The QA Engineer also configures the environment where the tests will take place, to verify that the software is free of bugs and that it works according to the initial requirements. If problems are detected, it is up to the QA Engineer to do the respective documentation to ensure quick fixes.\n\nMonitoring\n\nWhen working on the same project for a long time, attachments gro deep, leading programmers to cling to the final result in such a way that they ignore minor flaws and bugs. A QA Engineer brings an objective viewpoint to the project, with a neutral, impartial, and detailed review of functions and failures.\n\nIn short, a project must be consistent and reliable enough to appear, in the eyes of the client, as if it was done by just one person. Although many people are involved in the work, a QA Engineer is the unifying element that gives cohesion to the different parts of the project.\n\nNear Partner, the QA Engineers team you need to evolve\n\nThe world is constantly evolving, and the mindset, skill set, and work method need to step it up. At Near Partner, we’re a\n\ncohesive team of skilled software engineers\n\nwith several areas of expertise. We’re ready to support you on your next step, providing you with error-free software for the entire organization.\n\nGet in touch\n\n!",

    "content": "But even as tech companies put out all the stops to\n\nattract\n\nthe best talent, with flexible work arrangements, higher salaries, and starchitect offices,\n\nworker unhappiness is at all-time high\n\n. This is about more than sustainable\n\ncompanies;\n\nit is about millions of people\n\n’s\n\nlives.\n\nAfter all, with such competitive conditions in tech market, what are the reasons that don’t allow happiness at work?\n\nWhat is happiness at work really (not the HR definition)?\n\nManaging happiness at work has become the number one mission of highly competitive companies. The end game is that employees feel fulfilled and motivated regarding their professional activities. But despite all the effort, money and awkward “optional” corporate hangouts, most are failing miserably at it.\n\nDespite intense media focus and corporate spinning, happy workers are the exception: r\n\necent reports\n\nshow how job unhappiness is at a staggering all-time high.\n\nWorkers are experiencing staggering rates of disengagement and unhappiness and 60% of people reported being emotionally detached at work and 19% as being miserable. And those numbers hold true for workers in remote and hybrid arrangements, and even those working 30 hour-weeks.\n\nSo if it is not just about salary or working in your jammies, what is it about? Is it just “liking what you do”? Not counting the hours left on the clock or the days until the weekend? Is it about the recognition of colleagues, a good salary, a sense of purpose and meaningful work that impacts society?\n\nIt could be all that, and more. For some, it is the relations between colleagues, recognition and mutual help. For others, the events, results, the internal environment learning. And some value professional evolution and the feeling of purpose. Each person has their own “code” – unique personal and genetic circumstances, which shape their definition of happiness.\n\nFor most people, however, it is about fair treatment at work–a culture that emphasizes respect, community, and contribution acknowledgement.\n\nThis is not surprising when we consider that, on average, each of us spends about 90,000 hours working throughout our lives.\n\nHigher salaries quickly depreciate if day-to-day life is austere, inflexible, tense, heavy, or tedious\n\n.\n\nOf course, you can’t be happy 100% of your time at work. But you can choose how to think about things, how to react, and how to shape circumstances. And this is where leaders and organizations come in, with policies, practices, norms, and cultures that contribute to happiness —or not.\n\nMany organizations still adopt a tactical approach, providing moments of well-being, but without creating a true culture of organizational happiness. This requires a long-term strategic vision based on shared values, and an investment to identify what is most important to each employee that is not limited to isolated initiatives. It is essential to create a follow-up process to act on these issues, as each employee is in a specific professional and personal phase and has different\n\nneeds\n\n. Otherwise, it will be impossible for companies to keep up with their human capital\n\nneeds\n\n.\n\nWhy is Happiness Management so important?\n\nThe latest reports\n\nsimply reinforce what we all already know:\n\nhappy employees are more productive, feel better in their own skin and contribute to society. When you work surrounded by happy people, communication is fluid and healthy, contributing to a good working environment. When you do not, the whole atmosphere can feel claustrophobic. If it gets bad enough that someone leaves, it affects the entire team – feelings of loss are inevitable and can compromise internal dynamism.\n\nHappiness is and will always be an intrinsic state, so no one or no company can be fully accountable for an individual’s happiness. But companies – and managers in particular – do have a role to play.\n\nAn essential part of the solution for the concerning number of workers that express job dissatisfaction, disengagement, and burnout, is better leaders in the workplace.\n\nBusinesses can strive to create conditions for each individual to find their own definition of happiness at work. Yes, people go through challenges and difficulties, and it is not always possible to get happy about life. It is possible, however, to provide the environment and resources to face circumstances in the best possible way.\n\nHow Happiness works at Near Partner\n\nAt Near Partner, we take our role in providing a fun and meaningful work environment very seriously. This is how.\n\nEncourage well-being\n\nYou got to have time to relax during an intensive, productive workday, to avoid burnout and waste hours lingering away at your desk. That is why we create fun spaces, such as ping-pong and relax station. Our Partners do understand the importance of balance and cohesion, so they created monthly Games Night, where we share board games and a lot of fun.\n\nUnite the team\n\nIt sounds cliché, but we just love it. We organize meetings and get-togethers outside the work sphere to get to know our B-side – that part of us that does not show up for work. And on special occasions or whenever we reach a certain milestone, we are happy to celebrate it together.\n\nPromote dialogue\n\nAgain, not to sound cheesy, but people have a voice at Near Partner. It is not just about being the loudest or the most senior, you are welcome to chip in. We make the most of each one’s skills in the company’s decisions. It is not just about happiness – it makes sense not to waste talent, and it is how we are unable to create better products and services.\n\nProvide consistent feedback\n\nDid something great? Outstanding. Dropped the ball? We will let you know and have a frank discussion about that as well. No problem – there are no superheroes here, no one is on top of their game every time, all the time. Missteps happen and as long as people deal with them head on, we get through it stronger. That is why we share consistent and mutual feedback on where and how to improve together and as a team.\n\nProvide growth opportunities\n\nHere, people are free to search for other opportunities that allow them to grow. There is no shortage of growth opportunities at Near Partner. Challenging projects, demanding customers, new colleagues from around the globe and with different backgrounds – there is always something new going on. It is what enables us to evolve professionally.\n\nThere are also alternative career paths – is Salesforce development not working for you anymore? Try your hand at Project Management. Stagnated in low-code development? Maybe UX is the way to go. Daniel Pinho is the perfect example of how change can impact your growth, he started as an Outsystems Developer and he is now part of our Salesforce team.\n\nMake it flexible\n\nRemote, hybrid, physical, or something in between?\n\nAt Near Partner, the work-life balancing act is fluid. People are free to make their own arrangements, that best suit their lives. Yes, in-person collaboration is important and, but flexibility is built into our source code.\n\nHappiness Management: The Near Partner’s Superpower\n\nWe are proud to say that Near Partner has been ranked by Happiness Works 2021 in the top 20 happiest companies. By the words of our CEO and Founder, Pedro Veloso, “Near Partner was born from the notion that when good people come together, in a perfect blend of comfortable surroundings and interesting challenges, a virtuous circle of innovation emerges.”\n\nAnd that’s our superpower, from day one: putting work, empathy, mutual help, and kindness to each other in our top priorities, the basis of\n\nour culture today\n\n. This is our formula to a happy work environment.\n\nFor our Head of Data Analytics,\n\nFilipe Sá\n\n, working in Near Partner is to “learn, find new challenges, and meet an exciting team”. Also,\n\nNelson André\n\n, our OutSystems Champion views Near Partner as a workplace strongly committed to everyone’s personal and professional development. “It may seem corporate propaganda, but here it actually means something.”\n\nGet to know us, come aboard, and\n\nwork with one of the happiest companies in Portugal\n\n!",

    "content": "zettabytes of complex data, however, is a different story\n\n.\n\nThis is what data migration means and how to do it in 8 steps.\n\nHere are some fast facts: businesses spend time and money migrating data between information-intensive applications. Yet,\n\nup to 75 percent of new systems\n\nfail to meet expectations. Often, because flaws in the migration process result in data that is not suited for its new purpose. To skip this trap, it is important to understand the hidden challenges. Here’s 8 practical steps to get you started.\n\nBut first, what will we approach?\n\nWhat is data migration?\n\nData migration: why is it so important?\n\nHow to perform data migration in 8 steps\n\nWhat is data migration?\n\nSimply put, data migration refers to the transfer of information from one system to another. It is often necessary when companies need to move local databases to the cloud, replace legacy systems or roll out a shiny new web app.\n\nVolume of data/information created, captured, copied, and consumed worldwide from 2010 to 2020, with forecasts from 2021 to 2025. Source:\n\nstatista\n\nWhatever the case, Data Migration’s importance is often underappreciated, regarded as a necessary but non-value adding task. It is actually a complex process that, if not properly planned, can have serious operational and financial consequences. Data must go through various stages, ending only with the shutdown of the old system. Along the way, inaccuracies, redundancies and duplications become apparent – and robust structures of the past suddenly seem outdated.\n\nData migration: why is it so important?\n\nData migration is about survival. Well, of sorts. We all know the statistics: data is being generated faster than ever and evermore diverse and complex –\n\n90% of all data has been created in the past 2 years alone\n\n. Accessing, digesting and securing it is a key strategic advantage. So it is hardly surprising that companies that excel at data management – and migration – live longer and stronger. The goal is always to improve performance, deliver relevant insights from raw data, and enable better decision making. But to do that data integrity – its quality – is vital.\n\nBesides the need to keep up with digital transformation, data migration also facilitates access to information from other locations, avoiding expenses with the maintenance of physical structures and other operational costs. Furthermore, resources are also better protected from technical failures, hardware problems or\n\ncyber-attacks\n\n, which are more likely to occur in local servers.\n\nWhen it comes to large-scale systems, data migration can take years to complete. In such cases, it is vital to have a well-defined strategy, to know the data and resources will be transferred and to foresee maintenance and prevention issues.\n\nHow to perform data migration in 8 steps\n\nA strategic data migration plan will vary based on the company’s needs and goals, but it should follow 8 key steps.\n\n1. Plan ahead\n\nFirst, get to know existing assets and design a migration roadmap. Define the current system requirements and how they can be adapted to the new structure to identify pain points. Outline the new requirements and other necessary resources, specify the budget and deadlines. Don’t forget to document all stages.\n\n2. Clean it up\n\nBefore performing it, make sure the data is clean and ready to go. Filter unnecessary data, check for missing fields, define the bare minimum to extract, what can be left behind and what is missing. This eliminates duplicate, unnecessary or friction-provoking handling of data. As this step can be time-consuming and cumbersome, you may want to consider an\n\nautomation tool\n\nto steer this audit. But a keen, expert, human eye is always helpful. This is kind of challenge our Data Analysts here at Near Partner love to sink their teeth in.\n\n3. Secure it all\n\nSecurity never hurts, and when it comes to data, it is even more important, as some issues may not be immediately foreseen. Do we need to say it? Back up your data in a secure space before the actual migration. With this extra layer of protection, you don’t lose data if something unexpectedly fails. Use a reputable backup service with encryption, keep multiple copies and regularly check up on the status of the backups.\n\n4. ETL it\n\nExtract, transform, and load (ETL) – these are the next steps to data migration. ETL is a process that involves extracting data from a source system, transforming it to meet the requirements of the new system, and loading it.  At this stage, a software engineer specialized in ETL and a systems analyst should be present, especially if the migration involves large volumes of data and complex flows. Such professionals can develop scripts for ETL procedures or turn to process-specific automation tools.\n\n5. Keep track of data\n\nThroughout data migration, it is important to track all steps and ensure that they do not interfere with normal operations. Monitoring data migration can be done in a number of ways, depending on the type of data being migrated and the tools being used.\n\nSome common methods include logging data movement activity, using monitoring tools provided by the migration tool vendor, and setting up alerts to notify staff of any issues. The most important thing to monitor is the data itself, to ensure that it is moving as expected and that no data is lost or corrupted in transit. To do this, it is important to have a clear understanding of the data being migrated, including its structure, content, and meaning.\n\nThere are also a number of KPIs that can be used to monitor data migration, depending on the specific goals and objectives of the project. Some common KPIs include data throughput, data accuracy, data completeness, and data timeliness. Tracking such KPI reduces the risk of data migration leading to downtime or critical failures.\n\n6. Run the Litmus test\n\nA Litmus test is a quick and easy way to determine whether data will be successfully migrated from one system to another. The test is typically performed by running a small data set through the migration process and then checking to see if the data can be accessed and used in the new system. If it can, then the migration is successful. If not, then the migration has failed. It is important to test at all stages – whether in planning, execution, or post-migration – to correct problems in a timely manner and to ensure the safe and high-quality flow of all data.\n\n7. Validate\n\nOnce data migration is completed, an audit is required to validate the results with key business users. This step ensures that the data has been moved and recorded correctly. Gather a group of users to test and help you understand if the migration has negatively affected common day-to-day tasks. Then, perform a post-migration audit. This process ensures that the data was migrated correctly and that none was lost. It can be conducted manually or through automated means. In order to conduct a post-migration audit test, all data that was migrated must be compared to the source data. This can be done by comparing checksums or by manually inspecting the data. All data that is found to be different must be investigated to determine if the differences are due to errors in the migration process or if the data is simply different in the new system.\n\n8. Deactivate\n\nAfter the post-migration audit, and when you are sure that the process was a complete success, the old system needs to be deactivated. Then update the backup to current formats so everything is in line with the new features and ready for the next migration.\n\nGetting started with data migration\n\nIf you are on your way to upgrading systems, moving to the cloud, or consolidating data, a data migration is approaching in the near future, or, better said, in the\n\nNear Partner\n\n. How’s so? Data migration is a critical step of any upgrade.

    "content": "Stay with us and learn what it is, why you should care about it and how to approach implementation.\n\nTraditional security practices often won’t cut it in a modern IT environment. It takes more than generic guidelines and wishful thinking to build secure applications. That’s when DevSecOps steps in, a trending and essential practice that introduces security early in the software development life cycle. This is what it means, why it matters, and how to take the first steps towards implementing it. Here’s what you’ll learn:\n\nWhat is a DevSecOps?\n\nWhy should you care about Deviascope?\n\nDevSecOps: how to implement\n\nDevSecOps: Taking the next step\n\nWhat is a DevSecOps?\n\nDevSecOps is a team organization method that combines\n\ndevelopment (Dev), security\n\n(SEC) and operations (Ops). Put simply, these functions work together at every stage of the software development cycle, from requirements identification to delivery. The goal is to integrate security into the very fabric of any piece of software. Traditionally a separate function, DevSecOps rings security to the forefront of development, a key concern for everyone involved. As a result,\n\ncybersecurity is not just an afterthought\n\n, but coexists with all other requirements.\n\nIn short, DevSecOps emerged as a process to develop software faster, safer and more aligned, involving three key areas from the onset of development.\n\nWhy should you care about DevSecOps?\n\nIt essential for businesses that put security first from the beginning of a project. Crucially, it represents a breaking point from the traditional view on software development: coders will code. Then, security teams come in to run all the checks before delivery (or worse, after delivery, leaving customers vulnerable to outside threats). The result?\n\nTechnical debt\n\n, long delays, dubious code, rework – all of which are usually more expensive once the code is already in production.\n\nSince DevSecOps handles security issues from the beginning of the project, it prevents these frictions from even occurring. Throughout the\n\ndevelopment cycle\n\n, code is reviewed, audited, verified, and tested for security issues. Development team fixes vulnerabilities as soon as they identify them, and this preventive action makes it possible to deliver an end product faster and complete.\n\nIn addition, it also allows you to build a more resilient system, where security is built-in by default rather than hastily added as a quick fix. On the other hand, DevSecOps gets things done more efficiently and cost-effective, as it is easier and less expensive to detect and fix vulnerabilities before they go into production than after release.\n\nAlso, a mature DevSecOps implementation will have solid automation, making the process repeatable and adaptable. This ensures that security is applied consistently, even as the environment changes and adapts to new requirements.\n\nAll things considered, DevSecOps is the kind of mindset that allows for quality, speed and scalability of projects, where everyone is responsible for security.\n\nDevSecOps: how to implement\n\nTo implement DevSecOps, organizations must first include the security team in the design process so that their concerns are considered from the beginning of any project. Security experts are vital to identify potential hazards and provide suggestions to mitigate them, thus avoiding problems that may arise further down the road. The idea is to replace a reactive with a preventive attitude.\n\nNext, it’s important to integrate some security tools throughout all stages of development. For instance, most DevSecOps teams will use some sort of debugger to check for code and design errors as they write them – rather than rely on someone to review their code for them. Also, it is important to check for new open-source vulnerabilities. Keeping an eye out for new entry points is also within DevSecOps and guess what – there are tools to do that as well.\n\nWhen possible, the security\n\nverification process should be automated\n\n. Automation enables much better leverage of existing staff resources than manual processes, preventing security work from being a bottleneck to business KPIs.\n\nDevSecOps: Taking the next step\n\nSo, loving the idea, but wondering how to take the next step? As with any change, it may seem overwhelming. That’s why you should rely on DevSecOps experts. At Near Partner, we are used to tackling challenges and always ready to upskill your security practices.\n\nGet in touch\n\n!",

    "content": "Today’s fast-paced and always-on mindset is speeding the transition.\n\nHere are 8 trends of digital transformation beyond 2023.\n\nDigital Transformation is nothing new. Still, it is enjoying revived attention in this post-pandemic, high-inflation age. Transitioning saves costs, makes companies more agile, drives growth, and frees people to more creative tasks. It is no wonder why so many businesses are using it as a competitive advantage – or to survive such a competitive landscape. Here’s why Digital Transformation matters now more than ever and what to expect in years to come.\n\nTopics we’ll approach:\n\nDigital Transformation: the new normal\n\n8 trends changing the face of Digital Transformation\n\nDigital Transformation: the new normal\n\nIn 2018, 70-year-old Toys ‘R’ Us closed its doors for good. The store collapsed as it couldn’t keep up with the rise of virtual games and online shopping experience. At the same time, and almost with the same age, Domino’s Pizza, one of the world’s leading pizza takeaway brands, introduced\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nto reach high levels of food safety, improve traceability, and reduce costs. Domino’s kept eating away market share from long-standing competitors (pun super intended).\n\nThe key takeaways? Companies need to overcome resistance to change and make the digital leap, blending skills with technological knowledge to provide state-of-the-art services. The numbers speak for themselves; legacy companies rushed to adopt new technologies to survive, with ever-growing spending on digital transformation, reaching the striking figures of 2,39 trillion U.S. dollars in 2024.\n\nSource:\n\nStatista\n\nBut is it worth it? Again, let the numbers do the talking and take the HP example. The brand merged 85 data centres into 3 virtual ones in 2008, improving their performance by 250% and cutting costs by 50%. One of many cases that highlight the power of digital transformation in process efficiency, overall savings, and customer experience. So,\n\n8 trends changing the face of Digital Transformation\n\nThe strength of Digital Transformation is in how companies can integrate multiple technologies within a customer-centric strategy. Here’s how digital transformation looks like, now and in the years to come.\n\n1. Near Shoring\n\nThis new trend of collaborative partnership has become one of the most fundamental services for companies around the world. When the objective is to simplify the process without compromising quality,\n\nnear shoring\n\nallows access to the best talent in technology and a high production speed. Thus, this form of outsourcing is about more than just delivering a service – it is part of high-level decisions on decisive issues, like strategic partners who share risks and achievements.\n\n2. Automation\n\nAutomation\n\naims to replace manual tasks with repetitive processes so that they can work without human intervention. This trend is revolutionary because it improves efficiency and productivity to an unprecedented level. Companies still have plenty of room to automate many repetitive tasks that are not yet mediated by computers–especially in sectors where IT advances at a slower pace–and thus to free up manpower to do new things.\n\n3. No-code and low-code development\n\nLow-code and no-code\n\ntools are an important part of the engine of true digital transformation, as they enable non-developers to build applications using common building blocks and simple graphical interfaces, accelerating digital transformation initiatives. Not only does it eliminate digital exclusion, it also prevents teams from spending disproportionate amounts of time building and maintaining in-house tools and managing\n\ntechnical debt\n\n.\n\n4. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\n\nsoftware solutions are not just a trend but a dominant force in today’s tech world, reaching into areas as diverse as healthcare, finance, education, transportation, or automated code generation. By reducing human involvement, it makes the process less error prone. One of the most expressive examples of this technology is in the marketing space, which analyses customer’s preferences and behaviour, with reliability and speed.\n\n5. Cloud\n\nOn-premises infrastructure is progressively being replaced by\n\ncloud alternatives\n\n, a path to remove technological barriers to remote business connectivity and collaboration. Companies need access to data and applications in multiple locations at the same time. Cloud provides flexibility and scalability that can’t be found in on-premises infrastructure. This opens the door to faster innovation and more resilience.\n\n6. Automated software development\n\nWe will see more automated software development platforms in the coming years because of their outstanding features. From the onset, it becomes possible to launch customized software in a few weeks, even when technical talent is scarce. Automation layers are built on a flexible code base that can be customized according to customer requirements, enabling up to 90% faster time to market compared to building software from scratch.\n\n7. Cybersecurity\n\nFor digital transformation to take place successfully, security must be guaranteed. Sensitive data needs to be processed and stored securely. Therefore,\n\ncybersecurity and privacy protection\n\nare top priority issues, especially for companies for whom data is the most valuable resource.\n\n8. Agile and DevOps integration\n\nAgile\n\nand DevOps best practices are key to deliver services at speed. By integrating concepts such as frequent delivery, technical excellence, consistency and simplicity, IT teams can create repeatable and automated processes to streamline work. In addition, projects are divided into short and manageable phases to implement fixes and improvements.\n\nNear Partner, powering Digital Transformation\n\nUntangling the best people, initiatives and tech for each project is hard work. Powerful digital technologies are available, but you must know how to wield them, which can be a massive undertaking. If you’d like that extra help to boost your Digital Transformation efforts,\n\nget in touch\n\n. We’re happy to make your transition to digital-first happen seamlessly.",

    "content": "Wondering how you can leverage the incredible amounts of data generated by your business’ channels every single day?\n\nThis is how Data Lakehouse can help.\n\nAlthough Data Lakehouse sounds like a vacation spot for… data, it is, in fact, a specific type of data architecture that merges a Data Lake and a Data Warehouse. In case you are wondering, “Who even comes up with these names?” we can only answer people who have a taste for puns and somewhat weird analogies and metaphors. For the sake of simplicity, let’s say IT people are\n\nalso\n\nfun.\n\nThese are the topics that we will cover:\n\nThese are the topics that we will cover:\n\nWhat is a Data Warehouse?\n\nWhat is a Data Lakehouse?\n\nWhat are the key benefits of a Data Lakehouse?\n\nHow to implement a Data Lakehouse\n\nWhat is a Data Warehouse?\n\nThe concept of Data Warehouse dates back to the 80’s. It is a centralised repository for data accumulated from multiple sources. This means CRM software, relational databases, business applications, etc. Just like an actual warehouse, where goods are stored, the data in data warehouses is (highly) structured, and represents a central version of the truth.\n\nOk, let us give an example: a data warehouse might combine customer information from several sources within an organization, such as POS systems, mailing lists, website, or website or social media comments. Business analysts can use that later on to produce reports as part of Business Intelligence efforts. In time, this data can generate insights on customer preferences, help design a better shopping experience or provide efficiency opportunities.\n\nWhat is a Data Lake?\n\nWith the rapid growth of technology, the world started generating and collecting increasingly large amounts of data from different sources, like social media. These copious amounts of data became too large and too messy to be processed in data warehouses – and so data lakes emerged. A Data Lake is a data repository where data is stored in raw form, that is, both structured and unstructured, but essentially unrefined. Data lakes focus more on data storage rather than data management.\n\nWhere does the analogy to a lake come from? Well, think of an actual natural lake; it can have many rivers or small streams of water flowing into it, and the water from the various sources each with different quality or quantity; some of the water may be clean, and some may be dirty and muddy, some of it is constantly flowing, and some is seasonal. The point of a lake is it is not organised. Data lakes are playgrounds for data scientists, who use all that stored, unprocessed data, in machine learning, predictive analysis, or profile creation.\n\nSo, with data warehouses and data lakes defined, we’re now ready to move on to Data Lakehouses.\n\nSo, what is a Data Lakehouse?\n\nA Data Lakehouse is a data architecture that combines the principles of a data lake (copious amounts of raw data) with a data warehouse (manageable structured data). A Data Lakehouse is a solution that makes use of the best features of both concepts and avoids their respective shortcomings.\n\nConcretely, a Data Lakehouse stores all sorts of data –\n\nstructured\n\n(like excel spreadsheets, CSV files or relational databases with specific information),\n\nunstructured\n\n(like PDF files, images, video, and audio files), and\n\nsemi-structured\n\n(like TXT, HTML, JSON, or XML files with some kind of structure as titles, headers, paragraphs, labels, tags, etc) – and enables\n\nstructure\n\nand\n\nschema\n\nto be applied to this “jumbled” data.\n\nWhat is Data Lakehouse Source:\n\ndatabricks\n\nFrom a Data Lakehouse it is possible to extract structured data for\n\nBusiness Intelligence\n\n, and unstructured and semi-structured data to be used in data science, machine learning, and AI.\n\nWhat are the key benefits of a Data Lakehouse?\n\nThe long-story-short of a Data Lakehouse is the ability to derive intelligence from all sorts of data and provide meaningful insights and patterns which can be critical for the success of a business.\n\nOf course, you could maybe do it using separate data warehouse and data lake. But why use a multiple-solution system when you can simplify your life? The advantages of a Data Lakehouse over a combination of Data Warehouse + Data Lake are:\n\nLess time and effort spent in system administration.\n\nSimplified data governance and audit mechanisms.\n\nReduced data movement and redundancy (data copies).\n\nDirect access to source data by analysis tools.\n\nEnables data analysts and data scientists to be more self-sufficient.\n\nFaster time-to-insight.\n\nData storage that is cost-effective.\n\nLess resources (technology and human) to maintain the system.\n\nSeamless BI workflow with your BI tool.\n\nEasier to ensure data integrity.\n\nSeparation of storage and compute resources.\n\nSupport for IoT data.\n\nHow to implement a Data Lakehouse\n\nAs with any new concept, the success of Data Lakehouse hinges on its implementation. These are the key steps to build a Data Lakehouse:\n\nStart with a single data lake that holds every piece of data\n\nApply governance to your data lake, i.e., data warehouse principles\n\nOptimize your data for fast query performance\n\nProvide native support for machine learning\n\nUse open data formats and APIs in order to prevent lock-ins\n\nThis process is not trivial. There are certain business-end and IT-end requirements that need to be fulfilled in order to build a Data Lakehouse from a data lake, or even from scratch. Sounds difficult? With our IT expertise and your business knowledge, we can do it.\n\nData Lakehouse\n\nwith a (Near) Partner\n\nYour business has matured, and the next step is to start (really) leveraging data. At Near Partner we follow an innovative, data-driven philosophy, and we thrive by helping our customers succeed.\n\nIn the era of Big Data, we are more than equipped to provide help with the latest data analysis tools, as well as with the best practises in the business world.

    "content": "With the blockchain hype, tokenization is in the centre of every conversation.\n\nBut what does it\n\nmean for companies?\n\nTokenization effectively masks key business data to protect it from ill intended intruders. It is one of the simplest ways to improve cybersecurity, safeguard customer trust and avoid damaging data breaches. So why do so many businesses still struggle with the concept? This is what means for companies and how to implement it.\n\nWhat is tokenization?\n\nIn the general sense, a token is representation of something else with a higher value or importance. Take, for example, casino tokens, which represent real money, but have no value outside that casino. In logistics, a parcel is normally identified by a tracking number. While this string of numbers and letters may mean nothing to carrier A, for carrier B it holds all the information they need to transport and deliver, such as the delivery address, weight and dimensions of package and real-time location.\n\nThe same goes for software. A token represents the right to perform operation, just like security tokens, session tokens, or access tokens. Tokenization replaces sensitive data with other data (tokens) that hold no meaning or value to third parties. These unique identifiers contain the entirety or just a portion of the essential data to be protected and cannot be deciphered by anyone other than the party that emitted it and the party that is supposed to receive it. Tokenization is thus an important security protocol because even if tokens fall into the wrong hands, they are impossible to reveal, trace or decipher.\n\nSource: truust\n\nThe concept of tokenization was created in 2001, by TrustCommerce. In the early days of ecommerce, the goal was to protect payment data for one of their merchant clients, evading the risk of card holder data theft. With this solution, TrustCommerce stored customers’ credit cards and other banking information in a six-digit, alphanumeric BillingID, making the sensitive data contained in the token intelligible to other entities.\n\nWhy is tokenization important?\n\nWhile tokenization is often used in credit card processing, it safeguards other sensitive data or personally identifiable information like medical or criminal records, social security numbers, loan applications, stock trades or event voter registrations.\n\nOne of the most popular tokenization in the blockchain is\n\nNFT Tokenization\n\n. NFTs are digital data that represent unique assets that can be used as proof of ownership and allow for trading items or for authenticating transactions. NFTs are already applied for art, games, and intellectual property.\n\nGovernance tokenization, on the other hand,\n\nis directed toward voting systems with decentralized protocols. There are also tokens for utilities, which provide secure access to diverse services.\n\nHow can tokenization affect your company?\n\nTokenization can be used by, for, and within companies. These are the key benefits of tokenization for businesses:\n\n#1 – Reduced risk of data breaches\n\nData is precious nowadays, as we currently live in the data era. Because of this, data breaches are increasingly common, and increasingly sophisticated. If your customers’ data are tokenized, i.e., protected, data breaches become less of a risk and have much less serious implications.\n\n#2 – Improved customer-business relationships\n\nThis is a no-brainer. Customers want their personal data safe. The safer they feel, the more trust they put on your business. And trust goes beyond just payment information. It includes other sensitive data, like phone numbers or email addresses.\n\n#3 – Improved internal security\n\nMost businesses strive to connect data from different areas to provide cross-functional insights. But sometimes, sensitive pieces of data, like medical records, cannot be reconciled with customer data, due to privacy violations. Tokenization can fix this by masking sensitive information so that data can be communicated across departments, such as billing and marketing, without breaching privacy.\n\n#4 – Legacy system communication\n\nAn underrated benefit of tokenization is its ability to work well with legacy systems. An application and/or database that has been in use for years does not need reinventing, and it does not need to be built from scratch, to tokenize the information secured in it.\n\n#5 – Reduced cost vs. encryption\n\nEncrypting data uses more resources than tokenization and has a higher risk of failure compared to other data-masking methods.\n\n# 6 – Improved compliance\n\nTokenization dramatically reduces the costs and efforts required to comply with security policies and regulatory\n\nstandards such as the Payment Card Industry Security Standard (PCI DSS)\n\nand simplifies the protection of other sensitive data, including personally identifiable information (PII).\n\nHow can you get started with tokenization in your business?\n\nAs always, one repeated question with innovation is “Is this really for my business?” There is this idea that only highly technological companies can use the newest technologies, and that small businesses can never benefit from anything new. This could not be more wrong. Innovation is key for success, be it for a company of ten, or of ten thousand workers. The secret, though, relies on knowing which technologies can benefit your business, how to set up the whole transition, and when to do it. And this is where we come in.\n\nAt Near Partner, we are fans of innovation. Are you looking for a tokenization solution?\n\nGet in touch\n\n!

These are the 7 best backend frameworks available to developers today.\n\nHere it goes:\n\nWhat is a Backend framework?\n\nThe best frontend frameworks in 2022\n\nWhat is a Backend framework?\n\nWeb development can be divided into frontend and backend development, also called user-side and server-side development, respectively. This means that the frontend part interacts with the user, while the backend part deals with the inner functioning of a web application or website. Ultimately, a web app or website needs both to work properly.\n\nBuilding the frontend and the backend of an app requires frameworks. With frontend, a developer needs a frontend framework – check this list of the\n\n7 hottest frontend frameworks in 2022\n\n. And as for backend development, a\n\nbackend framework\n\nwill do.\n\nFront-end vs Back-end. Source:\n\nIronhack\n\nThis\n\ntool or pla\n\ntform\n\nis used to build the server-side of a web application and comes equipped with libraries, toolboxes, methods, and ready-made components of server-side programming languages. While working on a\n\nbackend framework\n\n, a developer will focus on servers, databases, how they connect and communicate, and how the information and structures on the server-side interact with the user-side.\n\nChoosing the best\n\nbackend framework\n\nrequires considering developer skills, tech knowledge, programming language, as well as purpose and kind of application or website. So, if the time has come for you to think about\n\nbackend frameworks\n\n, have a look at the 7 best\n\nbackend frameworks\n\n.\n\nThe best frontend frameworks in 2022\n\nSome programming languages have many choices of\n\nbackend frameworks\n\n, and, as a rule of thumb, the more popular the languages, the more popular the frameworks. However, other factors need to be accounted for, such as learning curve, maturity, or functionalities. So, without further ado, here are the 7 best\n\nbackend frameworks\n\nto use right now.\n\nMost in demand programming languages of 2022. Source:\n\nCoding Nomads\n\nASP.NET Core\n\nASP.NET Core is the successor of ASP.NET. It is an open-source, cross-platform (platform-independent) framework used to build web applications in .NET. Regarded as one of the best\n\nbackend frameworks\n\nin terms of performance, ASP.NET Core is based on the MVC framework, has robust Cloud support, and supports modular architecture exceptionally well. It runs on Windows, Mac, or Linux operating systems.\n\nASP.NET Core allows developers to build modern, cloud-optimized, and mobile backend applications. Applications created with this backend framework can either be deployed on the cloud or run on premises.\n\nGo Agile: see the\n\ndifferences between Scrum and Kanban\n\n.\n\nSpring\n\nSpring Framework is one of the best\n\nbackend frameworks\n\nfor the evergreen language Java. First released in 2002, it boasts plenty of handy functionalities like caching, transaction management, configuration management, monitoring, or security.\n\nSpring Framework allows devs to create high performance and reusable code, and any kind of Java application. It is also a lightweight framework, making it one of the best\n\nbackend frameworks\n\naround, especially for Java.\n\nDjango\n\nDjango is a high-level framework for the programming language Python. It is one of the best\n\nbackend frameworks\n\nbecause, just like Python, it has an extensive community and documentation, all the while being highly scalable, customizable, and equipped with pretty much anything a developer could need. Also, there is a wide range of third-party plug-ins available.\n\nThe Django framework focuses on code reusing, based on the Don’t-Repeat-Yourself principle, which enhances development speed. It is a very secure\n\nbackend framework\n\n, ideal for large-scale and database-driven web applications. In case of small projects, be aware since Django could make that small project too stuffed with needless characteristics.\n\nThe Django REST framework (DRF) is\n\na toolkit built on top of the Django web framework that reduces the amount of code you need to write to create REST interfaces.\n\nWhat is the difference between Django and Django REST API?\n\nDjango is the web development framework in python whereas the Django Rest Framework is the library used in Django to build Rest APIs\n\n. Django Rest Framework is especially designed to make the CRUD operations easier to design in Django. Django Rest Framework makes it easy to use your Django Server as an REST API.\n\nSome big websites created with Django include Mozilla, Pinterest, National Geographic, and Disqus.\n\nFlask\n\nFlask is a popular\n\nbackend framework\n\nwritten in Python. It is considered a micro web framework because it does not need to use functions from third-party libraries. Flask runs on the web server, making it fast and effective, especially to build smaller applications. It’s a simple, highly flexible, and high-performing\n\nbackend framework\n\n, easier to use than Django, and also easier to learn as it requires less  code to create a simple web application.\n\nNetflix, LinkedIn, Lyft, and Airbnb are some companies that use Flask in their modern web applications. Flask is based on Unicode.\n\nRails\n\nRails, also called Ruby on Rails, is a free and open-source server-side web application framework, loaded with structures for databases, web services, and web pages. It is a beginner-friendly\n\nbackend framework\n\nthat combines Ruby, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to develop dynamic applications.\n\nRuby generates code that is compact, elegant, and powerful, and both Ruby and Rails are easy to understand and learn, as well as easy to test and compile. This is one of the best\n\nbackend frameworks\n\nto create prototypes and Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), fast. Some of the giants that use Ruby on Rails include Netflix, Hulu, Shopify, GitHub, or Zendesk.\n\nExtensions and packages are called gems in Ruby. Gem is a library or a packaged reusable collection of code. It can be large or small, but it is usually organized by some specific goal it allows you to accomplish. Gems can use other gems to create a more complex gem.\n\nExpress.js\n\nExpress.js is an open-source and free backend framework. Designed for web applications, websites, and APIs, it is the\n\nde facto\n\nstandard server framework for Node.js an Express.js, with which developers can create single-page, multi-page, or hybrid applications. Since JavaScript is the most popular web development language and provides full-stack development, learning Express.js is a smart choice for programmers. Companies like Twitter, Intuit, Trustpilot, and BlaBlaCar.\n\nuse Express.js in their tech stacks.\n\nLaravel\n\nLaravel is an open-source web framework, written in PHP, one of the most used backend programming languages. It is a beginner-friendly framework with an intuitive interface packed with an advanced toolbox, ideal for building modern and secure web applications.\n\nIts syntax is expressive and elegant, and the framework has excellent exception and error handling, allowing web developers to create flexible and creative applications, while taking care of the background details. Some of the companies using Laravel in their tech stack are 9GAG, Wisesight, Kmong, and Razorpay.\n\nDo you know the\n\ndifference between traditional and no-code development\n\n?\n\nLooking for a Backend Partner?\n\nTime to build a new web app. Do you need an\n\nextended team\n\nto assist your in-house team?\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\n, we know there is no one size-fits-all solution, and each business’ needs are different.

    "content": "to the Near Partner family, proudly representing Belgium in this\n\nbusting\n\nmelting pot\n\nof\n\na\n\nteam. When she’s not busy learning a new language\n\nor scavenging excel files for hidden\n\ndata\n\ngems, she’s happy to indulge in a\n\n(not so)\n\nguilty pleasure.\n\nLet us introduce her.\n\nMeet Laetitia\n\nLaetitia’s career path is far from straightforward. Before moving to Portugal, she studied Bioengineering in Brussels; worked as a Project Manager for two large Belgian multinationals and, already in Portugal, for a French startup; learned Portuguese and English fluently; tried her hand in the Food Industry, and more recently IT.\n\nDespite the packed CV, she keeps her cool about what drives her to challenge herself.\n\n“I guess I am just curious. All these unique experiences and cultures gave me valuable insights, tools and work methods I can apply in my new work challenges and projects and enable me to adapt myself better to different work contexts. They led me to various changes that enabled me to grow professionally and personally.”\n\nProject Management, in a nutshell\n\nSo what does an IT Project Manager do, exactly?\n\nThe main objectives are to lead both the teams and projects to success, facilitating progress by removing obstacles and supplying resources. Project Managers keep things running smoothly by focusing on the deliverables and being mindful of risks and constraints. This can lead to a reduction of costs and lead-time, improved efficiency and higher value to the customer. No matter the size of the company, the end goal is always the same: deliver on-time, on-budget and on-quality.\n\nIf it sounds difficult, Laetitia clarifies.\n\n“A Project Manager is like a maestro, coordinating musicians playing various instruments, each with a specific purpose. Together, they deliver a product with quality and value to the public: a symphony. A Project Manager is both a facilitator and communicator, translating a partition into music, ensuring everyone shares the same vision.”\n\nIn Laetitia’s current role, that means “conducting” different projects, customers and teams at the same time. Crucially, a Project Manager requires the ability to cope with changes, and adapt to different cultures, tools, methodologies and work environments – something Laetitia’s background shaped her to do.\n\nWhy is Project Management important Source:\n\nkissflow\n\nIt also helps to be a good listener – even when the music is not playing. “It is essential to understand customer’s needs, analyze the feedback, and transform it into a final product with value; as well as to listen to team members, understand their motivation, and detect early warning signs.” A Project Manager can understand the end game, but also the roadblocks to get there. It requires the perfect blend of attention to detail, time management skills, and priority setting.\n\nWhere is Project Management headed?\n\nAccording to Laetitia, there are 2 fundamental trends currently driving Project Management.\n\nThe first is\n\nAgility\n\n. “Agility is a recent concept, towards which many companies are heading. This transition from a Waterfall mindset to an Agile one, can be challenging and time-consuming, as every company will have its own interpretation and implementation.”\n\nThe second is remote work. The generalization of remote work created more freedom and new ways of working and living, but also challenges in collaboration. Also, more and more\n\nprojects are Nearshore\n\n, meaning that team members can be spread around a continent or the globe. As a leader, a Project Manager can encounter some difficulties in managing relationships and creating effective teams.\n\nManaging the cultural shifts of agility and remote work can be challenging, but if done correctly, can unlock extensive value. It is all in a day’s work of a Project Manager.\n\nOur approach to Project Management\n\nFor us at Near Partner, starting a new project is always an exciting experience. And we get the same feeling of braving into something new, no matter how many times we have done it before. “We begin by understanding the client’s needs and requirements, in order to define the scope, budget and cost. Then, we gather and analyze all this information, propose a plan, discuss solutions and alternatives with the client.” This is where a skillet such as Laetitia’s is so relevant – it helps that a Project Manager can take part in the various stages of the project, even before it really kicks off.\n\nIn our fast-moving world, new trends and technologies are emerging every day. Project Management brings value to companies willing to adapt, by enhancing processes while keeping in mind the overarching company’s vision.\n\nWorking at Near Partner\n\nLooking for a place to enhance your Project Management skills? Laetitia came to Near Partner to chase the thrill of doing something new everyday. And there is time for more than just work. Despite managing large projects for many different companies, that impact thousands of people in several countries, Laetitia still finds time for pilates and yoga, walking, listening to podcasts or reading a good book in a park or at the beach.\n\nOh, she also takes pride in her plants, is a regular at art exhibits and enjoys the wonderful weather we have in Portugal. She also indulges in a guilty pleasure… of sorts: learning about Data Analysis/Visualization. That’s right, she can spend several hours analyzing data and designing dashboards. But hey, who are we to judge? Afterall, we each have our own drives.\n\nFilipe came to Near Partner looking “to learn, for new challenges, and to meet an exciting team”. Nuno Dias breaks down our company culture: “We believe that good people, left at ease to work within the frame of the company’s culture, will do good things for customers, colleagues, and the company. That’s the Near Partner way.”\n\nWhat drives you? If you’d like to know what it feels to work with an expert team in laid-back environment, reach out.\n\nWe have a spot for you.",

    "content": "of maturity, growth is only possible through legacy modernisation.\n\nFind out how to keep up with the challenges of digital transformation.\n\nBefore you accuse us of ageism, a legacy system may be old, relatively old, or even relatively new. While age may play a role, it is not the prime defining factor. So what is it?\n\nWhat is a legacy system?\n\nA legacy system is any system, method, technology, or application program that, while still in use, is becoming unstable, obsolete, or outdated.\n\nWhen does a system become “legacy”? Well, that depends, but as a good rule of thumb, a legacy system can still serves the purpose it was built for, but does not allow room for change or growth. In other words, it won’t keep up with the evolving needs of your business.\n\nSource:\n\niTech\n\nTake the example of\n\nDelta Airlines\n\n. In 2016, they experienced a 12-hour outage that resulted in the cancellation of over two thousand flights and 5 to 10 million dollars in lost revenue. This happened after an internal power outage caused the main system to go down and the legacy backup systems failed to reboot.\n\nWhile in most businesses a legacy system failure will hopefully not lead to millions in revenue losses, it will certainly add up to a hefty technical debt, and loss of trust and customer loyalty. But legacy systems are not only slowing your business down: they also pose serious security threats. And that’s why legacy modernisation is so important.\n\nWhat is legacy modernisation?\n\nLegacy modernisation refers to the processes of updating and optimizing business systems, transforming, or converting a legacy system into a modern infrastructure. The goal is to reduce IT costs, gain operational efficiencies, improve agility, and address technology constraints.\n\nLegacy modernisation is, however, a spectrum. One option for legacy modernisation is to refactor existing code using tools to migrate data, and to run the same system on more modern infrastructure. Another option is to re-architect the system, replacing the legacy system with one based on newer technology platforms or tools, like\n\ncloud native development tools\n\n.\n\nWhat are the benefits of legacy modernisation?\n\nMaintaining\n\nlegacy systems can cost any organization up to a 15% budget increase\n\nevery year for maintenance. Legacy modernization has several benefits for different areas of the company:\n\nMore security\n\n: IT threats keep evolving, and cybersecurity needs to follow suit. Legacy infrastructures are more exposed to risks because they lack of security updates, patches, and upgrades. As a result of technological evolution, previously secure legacy systems often become a real danger to the company.\n\nReduced IT costs\n\n: maintenance and upkeep of legacy systems require more effort – and thus, have a higher cost – than more modern ones. It is more difficult and time-consuming for developers to create, update and monitor age-old infrastructures than recent ones.\n\nIncreased IT agility\n\n: modernized systems react faster to fluctuations, integrate better with other systems, making it easier for your teams to leverage data across the organization, adapt to business conditions, or adopt innovative processes and technologies.\n\nFail-proof compliance\n\n: as regulations, audits, and controls become more strict, legacy systems go from being a nuisance to a priority. Due to lack of updates and upgrades, business become unable to ensure compliance. Legacy modernisation eliminates this problem, as new systems are designed to comply with present regulations – as well as adapt to the uncertainty of the future.\n\nEnhanced operational efficiency\n\n: legacy modernisation boosts the performance of your business by allowing your organization to better serve your customers, by producing more automated products and services, promoting faster time-to-market, and improving communication and collaboration between teams.\n\nHow can companies do legacy modernisation the right way?\n\nTo proceed with legacy modernisation in your company, be sure to keep in mind the following:\n\nOffer training and support to your teams, to ensure the transition is seamless\n\nIt is difficult to let go of something we like and are used to.\n\nA Spiceworks\n\nreport revealed that as of 2019, one third of businesses still ran on Windows XP. Yes, Windows XP, the operative system released in 2001, and whose support ended in 2014. To avoid resistance to the new systems, offer your team proper training during the adoption phase, and make sure there is proper support past this period.\n\nDetermine the right legacy modernisation strategy\n\nBased on how complex your legacy system is, or how modern you want your systems to be, you will need to choose the ‘R’ that fits your business’ needs best:\n\nCompletely decommission and replace existing legacy components.\n\nRestructure, optimize, and rebuild legacy elements in a cloud native environment.\n\nMove runtimes to a modern platform with minimal code changes.\n\nMove legacy elements to a new environment (such as a cloud infrastructure) without altering code or changing functionality.\n\nRefactor and Rearchitect.\n\nImplement more recent technologies into parts of the legacy system to take advantage of cloud-based or other systems, with some code changes.\n\nMaintain the current environment with no changes or updates.\n\nRetire the legacy system altogether.\n\nPrioritise and segregate\n\nSavvy businesses implement legacy modernisation one step at a time, simply because it is not doable to tackle the entire system all at once. It is essential to prioritize. This will make the modernization process easier and more structured.\n\nEmbed security at each stage of the legacy modernisation process\n\nA major concern with legacy systems is the low level of security that can lead to organization-wide threats. Therefore, it is a requirement to ensure that the process of legacy modernisation does not increase the vulnerabilities of your legacy system, but also identifies and fixes them.\n\nChoose your legacy modernisation partner carefully\n\nLegacy modernisation, especially of complex systems, can be tricky. Often, the in-house IT department does not have the resources to oversee the entire process on their own, from decision to deployment, since building new environments or modernising applications is not their core focus. Instead, it is essential that companies find a trusted partner to assist with the legacy modernisation process. At Near Partner, we specialise in\n\ndigital transformation\n\nand\n\nagile methodologies\n\nthat allow us to be your extended team.\n\nDo not let legacy systems keep your business in the past\n\nLegacy systems paved the way for your current standards. As your legacy systems get increasingly closer to obsoletion, so does your business get increasingly more vulnerable to threats. It is time to take that step and start the legacy modernisation process.\n\nHowever, knowing what, when and how to do it is not always straightforward, and involves quite a bit of planning, strategizing, and IT expertise.\n\nAt Near Partner we speak digital transformation, innovation, and Agile development. Our fantastic team is versed in a variety of programming languages and has solid experience in business environments. Let’s brainstorm together.\n\nGet in touch\n\nwith Near Partner, and let’s get your business prepared to face and overcome the next digital challenges. Take a look at our\n\nProject Cost Simulator\n\n, or\n\nwrite to us directly\n\nwith your questions and we’ll get back to you asap.",

This is a software program designed to be used on personal computers and tablets rather than large servers like some other tools.\n\nSAS allows users to analyze vast amounts of data in different ways, making it one of the most powerful tools available today. Though it can be difficult to use for those who are not experienced with software or computers.\n\n4.\n\nPower BI\n\nPower BI is one of the most cost-effective tools on the market. It allows you to gather data from multiple sources including internal databases, Microsoft Office documents, and social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and many others.\n\nPower BI also allows you to analyze your business trends through different metrics like profit/loss, revenue/expense, and gross margin.\n\nIt has an easy-to-use interface that lets you create interactive graphs and dashboards which can be connected to Excel.\n\nIt also provides you with customizable reports and insights. You can see your business from a new perspective and make better decisions based on current trends to improve your business performance in the future.\n\n5.\n\nMicroStrategy\n\nMicroStrategy is popular in a variety of different industries, including government and military intelligence, energy services firms, pharmaceutical companies, and even state tourism agencies.\n\nIt is a powerful tool that can help businesses with big data analysis. It provides everything you need to build reports with advanced features like drill-downs, pivot tables, and cross-tabs.\n\nThis tool can provide insights into complex company operations. It will also help you develop a clearer picture of your customers’ needs and interests to better tailor your product offerings—all from one central location.\n\n6.\n\nBirst\n\nBirst is a platform that provides support for any PostgreSQL database, giving users access to real-time business data and analytics.\n\nBirst is ideal for large enterprises that need to consolidate information from multiple sources; it will also integrate with some of your existing IT infrastructures such as BI tools, CRM systems, and ERP platforms.\n\n7.\n\nPentaho\n\nPentaho is an open-source business intelligence tool. It offers users the ability to create custom reports based on existing data using drag-and-drop tools and little knowledge of programming languages.\n\nPentaho’s interface makes it easy to share data across your organization. It can ultimately help contribute to increased productivity across all departments.\n\nThis software is great for people who are new to business intelligence applications but want to see instant results in their data analysis efforts.\n\n8.\n\nTidemark\n\nTidemark is a cloud-based platform that gives you access to over 1,000 sources of data. It is to analyze your company’s performance against industry benchmarks, competitors, and more.\n\nTidemark is a tool that gives businesses advanced visibility into their financial data. It lets them see the most important metrics in real-time. This means they can make smart decisions faster than ever before.\n\nIt offers more than just a single metric, too—it combines information from all areas of the business. After that, you can understand overall performance in context.\n\nThis means you can see how different parts of your business impact each other, which helps you catch problems quickly and keep them from getting worse. And it’s all done through an elegant, easy-to-use interface.\n\n9.\n\nTibco Spotfire\n\nYou can easily visualize data from your organization through interactive charts, dashboards, and more. Spotfire is easy to use, with built-in analytics for common types of data like financials, customer behavior, and even text mining.\n\nThe software also includes a variety of pre-built components in addition to analytic capabilities such as soft tissue identification, drug safety scoring, and signal transduction modeling. It’s ideal for anyone who needs a way to easily visualize and explore their data without breaking through the bank.\n\n10.\n\nCognos\n\nCognos is another type of BI tool that’s meant for large corporations with complex needs. This powerful product from IBM is designed to give you the most control over your data possible. It works well for companies with multiple departments and strong internal organizational needs.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs a company’s data grows, so too does the need to properly analyze and understand it. Business Intelligence tools help companies see past the walls of numbers they live behind.\n\nThey are also helping identify opportunities and trends that otherwise may have gone unnoticed.\n\nIf a company is to truly succeed in today’s hyper-connected world, they need to be able to quickly adapt to changing markets and conditions. That’s why it’s vital that they have access to insight in real-time. With these 10 Business Intelligence tools, your company will be able to gain valuable visibility into your business operations, no matter how big or complex.",

    "content": "CSS fanatics, unite! Exciting new features are here–and more are yet to come.\n\nThis what’s up with CSS latest version.\n\nThe programming world is abuzz with the prospect of CSS latest version. We looked under the hood to find out what was really going on – this is what we found.\n\nWhat is CSS?\n\nHere’s a quick recap. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a design language used for Frontend development. In simple terms, CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages, alter fonts, colours, sizes, content layout, add animations and so on. CSS is also, quite probably, the most popular Frontend development language in use.\n\nHere is a brief history of CSS versions and standards.\n\nSource:\n\nWilliam Hughes\n\nWhat’s new in CSS latest version: 8 key additions\n\nAlthough there are always new and exciting features being released, this latest version is the more than an update. In fact, it is the most significant change to this programming language in recent years. These are our favourite improvements.\n\n:has() :more than a parent selector\n\nThis command allows you to select elements (parents) that contain other elements (children) that match the selector you pass into :has(). For example, you can select images that are accompanied by captions, or style all the sections that have an H2. We in the dev community have waited a long time for this feature and now that is here we can not help but feel a little disappointed that only Safari supports it. Hopefully, other mainstream browsers will soon follow.\n\nContainer Queries\n\nResponsiveness in web design is not only a want but a need. Websites must be prepared to support various screens of different sizes. However, rearranging visual elements based on their viewport size can be tricky as not all elements adjust to their parent container automatically. With CSS’ latest version container queries, you now can modify your designs in a much more elegant way.\n\nSubgrid of Grid\n\nWhile grids may seem trivial, nested grids surely are a UI challenge – and not great for a customer’s\n\n1.\n\n. Aligning nested grids to their parent grid can be a total nightmare, namely regarding responsiveness because the inside element will frequently overflow. A subgrid is a perfect addition to CSS’ latest version and is already available on Firefox and Safari.\n\nAccent Colour\n\nYou can now change the colour of controls with a single line of code. Checkboxes, buttons, range inputs, or progress bars were typically a pain to style, but with accent-color, which is part of css-ui-4, it is now much easier to apply a specific colour while keeping the browser’s default input.\n\nNew Viewport Units\n\nRemember the gymnastics you had to do to go around the viewport bug on Safari for iOS? We do too. But there’s awesome news. There are twenty new viewport units in CSS, which are a result of the joint effort of Apple, Bocoup, Google, Igalia, Microsoft, and Mozilla. You can now use units\n\nsvh\n\n,\n\nlvh\n\n,\n\ndvh\n\n,\n\nsvw, lvw\n\n, and\n\ndvw\n\nto have more precise control over your designs and how they behave in relation to the users’ viewports.\n\nOverscroll Behaviour\n\nOverscroll-behavior\n\noverrides the default “bounce” that mobile browsers have when reaching the bottom of a page. If you continue scrolling down, you may see an empty area or, in some cases, refresh the page. While many websites already incorporate this feature, it generally this does not work very well as it may distract from the original content. Problem solved with this new feature.\n\n@when/@else\n\nEveryone who asked the online communities for an alternative to if/else statements in CSS: fingers crossed! The @where and @else operators are two conditional rules that will greatly simplify the writing of conditions and allow mutually exclusive rules with @else statements. Downside: this feature is not yet supported by mainstream browsers.\n\nCascade Layers\n\nManaging cascade conflicts is one of the most confusing things to do in CSS, for example, when trying to override styles from a, say, third-party tool. Cascade layers give developers much more control over the “cascading” part of CSS. Lower layers will take precedence over those in higher layers, even if those have selectors with higher specificity. What does this mean in practice? More agility, more simplicity, more elegance while writing code, and exciting new challenges.\n\nLooking for a Frontend Partner?\n\nIf you need help from CSS experts, be it for a frontend project, or an\n\nextended team\n\nto assist your in-house team in\n\nrewriting old legacy codebase\n\nonto responsive architecture, you are exactly in the right place. Our growing team loves challenges, that’s how we become better developers.\n\nTake a look at our\n\ndevelopment cost calculator\n\n.

    "content": "is the new stage of the internet, carried by blockchain, and promising decentralisation, accessibility, and transparency.\n\nBut what else is in a name?\n\nIf you keep an ear out for Silicon Valley jargon, Web3 may not be an alien concept to you. But what does it mean exactly, and how does it impact real life?\n\nWhat is Web3?\n\nTo understand Web3, we need to go back a few decades, to Web 1.0 and Web 2.0.\n\nWeb 1.0\n\nThe keyword for Web 1.0 is “read-only.” Web 1.0 was the first iteration of the web, which lasted from the early 90s to the 2000s. It comprised websites with static content that offered little interactivity, but displayed information in text or image format. In Web 1.0, applications were proprietary: users could download and use them, but they lacked have access to the source code. Take a trip down memory lane and check\n\nCERN’s website\n\n, a true landmark and the very first of its kind.\n\nWeb 2.0\n\nThe early 2000s brought along Web 2.0, the\n\nread-write\n\nweb, or Social Web, which is the one we still largely use right now. This is a participatory web dedicated to user-generated content. Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, even Myspace back in the day, are all examples of Web 2.0 applications. Web 2.0’s websites run on dynamic HTML, and most applications are open source. An example is Firefox, where\n\nusers can create their own applications\n\nand add-ons.\n\nWeb 3.0 (AKA. Web3)\n\nFinally, Web3. Still to fully take its hold in the digital world, the third generation of the web, or\n\nread-write-execute\n\nweb has decentralisation at its core. This means data is not stored in servers but on the network itself. Users can share information directly with other users, rather than going through the user-server-user traditional path. Being based on blockchain technology and AI, any change, access, or movement of that data is recorded on the blockchain, in principle making for a more transparent internet, and preventing misuse of data.\n\nTHE EVOLUTION OF THE WEB\n\nSource:\n\nFabric Ventures\n\nHowever, there’s more. Web3 is\n\nopen\n\nin the sense that networks would be built from open-source software, and by a community of developers. Another critical fea\n\nture is\n\nthat no institution mediates interactions between users, but by the users themselves. And finally,\n\neveryone\n\ncan take part with no authorisation by a governing third party.\n\nSince web3 is based on blockchain and artificial intelligence, it is inevitably intertwined with a series of other buzzwords, like cryptocurrency, NFTs, metaverse, Dapps, and more.\n\nWeb3\n\nimportant concepts\n\nThe concepts associated with Web3 are equally important to understand how it works and its basic principles.\n\nNFT\n\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are cryptographic tokens, or non-interchangeable units of data stored on a blockchain, that can be sold and traded. NFTs provide a public certificate of authenticity or proof of ownership to digital files such as photos, videos, or audio. An NFT is a 40-digit string of words and numbers that holds information pertaining to the file. For example, for a piece of digital art, the NFT contains information of the original artist, the current (and only) owner of the item, and the current price of the item.\n\nDAO\n\nA decentralized autonomous organisation (DAO) is an organisation with a flat hierarchy, governed by its users and without a central leader (or company) dictating decisions. DAOs are built on a blockchain using smart contracts.\n\nSmart Contracts\n\nA smart contract is an agreement between two parties written as a computer program or code. Smart contracts run on the blockchain – they are stored and processed on a public database and can be sent without a third party. Smart contracts are not controlled by the user, but deployed by the network itself, and cannot be changed. If smart contracts follow the same rules as a contract, they are legally binding.\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nCryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography to secure transactions. Cryptocurrencies rarely have a central regulating authority. Instead, cryptocurrencies use decentralised systems to record transactions and issue new units. Popular examples include Bitcoin or Ethereum.\n\nMetaverse\n\nThe metaverse is often described as a set of online spaces where people can work, socialize, and exist as avatars. In short, a virtual world that parallels our reality. If Second Life, the social and gaming platform came to mind, yes, that is exactly it. However, the metaverse is also evolving, hand in hand with VR and AR. By some estimates, the Metaverse will soon encompass gaming, telepresence, and social media.\n\nDeFi\n\nDecentralised Finance, or DeFi, is an open and global emerging financial technology that defies the traditional financial systems. The banking system is one of the best examples of centralisation: banks hold your money, charge you money for it, make money out of it; then, there are the third parties that facilitate transactions and charge a fee for it. Merchants, of course, are charged to receive money, and buyers are charged to pay money. It’s an endless cycle. Well, DeFi is the opposite. It eliminates intermediaries by enabling individuals to use financial services through emerging technologies, independently of who or where they are.\n\nDapps\n\nDapps are decentralised apps. They’re just like normal apps but built and run on the blockchain or another peer-to-peer network. This makes them difficult to control by any single authority, such as a government, which means they are censorship-resistant Dapps are also open-source, they operate on its own, use a cryptographic token to keep the network secure, and have all the data and records public.\n\nIs Web3 for everyone?\n\nWhile Web3 and its principles are very attractive, a deeper look reveals lingering issues and downsides. Web3 has many critics, including high-sounding names such as Elon Musk. One frequent criticism is that it is not really decentralised but centralised somewhere else, by other companies that aren’t the usual Tech Giants. There are also compliance issues:\n\nhow does GDPR work\n\nin a system that does not forget such as the blockchain?\n\nNFTs, on the other hand, raise questions due to their volatility and speculative nature, just like cryptocurrency. Smart contracts, DeFi, and DAOs pose new challenges in detecting and avoiding fraudulent activity or scams, given there is no regulating authority–like a government.\n\nHowever, there are also very outspoken supporters of Web3, one being Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood. Understandably, the promise of a more democratic content creation, control over privacy,\n\nimproved security\n\n, and tamper-proof networks, is exciting and bound to excite a large following.\n\nOverall, Web3 is still a work in progress, and opinions are frequently divided. Crypto enthusiasts see its potential of Web3 above anything else, while more sceptical eyes focus on the flaws and hypothetical scenarios.\n\nIf the Web3 has been on your mind and you want to prepare for the changes that are to come,\n\nget in touch\n\nwith us at Near Partner! We can help your organisation define a Web3 strategy and help make it come true. Write us a message with your thoughts and find out how we can help you get started, adapt, and breeze through the evolution of internet.",

    "content": "An efficient field service management app saves time, money and a lot of mistakes. So why do so many businesses fail at creating them? These are the most common pitfalls and how to avoid them.\n\nSales, customer support, maintenance and logistics teams. What do all these have in common? They work “in the field”, visiting customers, fixing what is broken and delivering goods. Ensuring these teams have access to relevant information saves time and money, but it can be a real challenge for even the savviest organisations. This is where field service management apps come into the picture. But what are they exactly?\n\nWhat are field service management apps?\n\nField service management applies to any resources deployed at a customer, third-party, or public locations. While this may be doable with an excel spreadsheet, scaling this artisan way of working gets messy–real quick! And if you are exploring the word of field service management apps or software, then you already know it.\n\nA field service management app facilitates, maintains and ensures mobility, as it allows data to be communicated in real time despite having scattered agents. For those who really take advantage of all the features in a field service management app, it can also improve productivity, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.\n\nBut despite its importance, many companies of all sizes still struggle to create efficient apps to support their teams in the field. Why?\n\nField Service Management apps: 8 best practices to ensure success\n\nSome have tried and failed. Others are yet to start altogether. Whatever your case may be, it is important to learn and avoid the most common pitfalls when creating such apps.\n\nClear purpose and goals\n\nWhen creating or buying a field service app or software, it is extremely important that you know what your goals are, and for exactly what purpose you need that app. Is your primary goal to track time, routes, materials? Or are you focusing more on increasing productivity, reducing downtime, or optimising routes? Which of these are priorities? Failing to settle on clear priorities from the start will probably lead to what is commonly known as a “frankenApp” – a freakishily ambitious app that sets out to do everything, and fails to get anything done at all. It is also a key pitfall in app development.\n\nUnderstand your business’ needs\n\nA field service management app is pretty much unique to each business. For example, a telecommunications maintenance app will not be the best fit for a business that provides healthcare services to elderly customers. The service is not the same, and the logistics will not be the same. Additionally, you need to think if there are material resources being deployed – other than humans, that is – and what is the best way to manage them.\n\nOrganize a “project team”\n\nBefore choosing a field management app, bring the internal “customer” teams together and listen to their opinions, on which features are needed, which are “nice to have”, and which might make the app too confusing or hard to use. Involving users early on, not just to list requirements but also to test them, is extremely beneficial for the smooth running of a system.\n\nTrain and engage your field technicians\n\nEven the simplest field service management app requires a certain level of training and support among users. Making field technicians work with an unfamiliar software will slow down their productivity. To avoid having your teams spending more time fiddling with the app than servicing customers, make sure you train your agents properly. That encourages them to ask questions and share ideas. Assigning a go-to person for your field technicians–or other employees–to ask questions is a clever idea too. Read more on why\n\nenterprise-grade app onboarding\n\nis important.\n\nFacilitate easy ERP/CRM integration\n\nNow, one of the most common pitfalls is not integrating software. Figure out which legacy software, ERPs, billing apps, or\n\nCRMs\n\nneed to be in contact with your field service management app. Keeping separate siloes can lead to scheduling conflicts, incorrect billing, lost records, delays in dispatch, and so on.\n\nGet feedback from field teams and customers\n\nThe only way to understand if your field service management app is doing its purpose is getting global feedback. That means field teams, office teams, management – and customers. What they like, what they don’t like, and what is missing. Oftentimes, field technicians will experience situations that are not expected and that will somehow affect the outcomes, but if there is no way to incorporate this information into the app, you won’t get accurate results.\n\nMake sure to add a “send feedback” button somewhere\n\nin the app for quick access.\n\nLeave room for exceptions\n\nWhat happens when an app user encounters an unexpected situation in the field? Apps should accommodate the unexpected and allow for exceptions. Say a customer needs your technician to provide an additional service outside a given work order. If you allow for a customisation module where customers and technicians can add adjoining work to a work order, for example, you will reduce the number of requests from customer support, and just streamline work, which will benefit teams and customers.\n\nKeep KPIs in mind\n\nA field service management app can guide your teams, make billing easier, and keep track of work. It is also a wonderful tool for you to gather data that can later measure or analyse efficiency, productivity, and all the metrics that will affect a business. We’re talking KPIs. Depending on your business, think about measuring time-to-site, jobs-per-day, first-time fix rates, call volumes, or others that might be relevant. And, of course, use them to your business’ benefit.\n\nWhat is the best Field Service Management app on the market?\n\nWell, this is a tough one, since in business there isn’t a “one-size-fits-all”. There are dozens (hundreds?) of field service management apps and software out there, catered to various industries, and with different levels of customisation, but only a handful will be a good fit for your business.\n\nIf you are a user of the Salesforce Service Cloud, you’ll be happy to know\n\nthere is an off-the-shelf\n\nField service management app that connects to Salesforce CRM. Of course, further customisation may be required for your unique business. If you are not a Salesforce user and are looking for a Field service management app outside Salesforce, you will need to go over quite a few of them until you find “the one”.\n\nWant to build your own Field Service Management app from scratch?\n\nThere is another, more tailored approach. Skip the pre-made modules and go straight for a custom app–the only way to ensure your field service management app is 100% adapted to your business.\n\nAnd did we hear you say you could use a hand? Well, we have great news: there are lots of helping hands at Near Partner, ready to build customised apps in whatever language you prefer. Do you want to customise your app yourself?

    "content": "Choosing a frontend framework can be a full-blown headache, and we know it.\n\nSo lay back, relax, and let us make a side-by-side comparison of React vs. Angular.\n\nReact and Angular are popular frontend resources that have plenty in common. Both are products of tech giants widely used for web app development. The more popular they become, the more the question seems to pop up: what’s the right choice in React vs. Angular? Join in and let’s look at React vs. Angular a bit more in-depth.\n\nBut first things first.\n\nWhat is React?\n\nReact\n\nis an open-source JavaScript library developed in 2013 by Facebook. It is mostly used to create User Interfaces (UI) but can also be deployed to create single-page apps for web or mobile. In that case, React needs to be used along other supporting tools, like containers, routers, code bundlers, state-management software, and testing tools.\n\nWhat is Angular?\n\nAngular\n\nis an open-source platform and web application framework developed in 2016 by Google. Angular allows to create single-page applications using TypeScript and HTML, with no additional libraries or tools.\n\nReact vs Angular. Source: Onemancode\n\nAnd on the topic of frontend: have you heard about the\n\nlatest news in CSS\n\n?\n\nReact vs. Angular\n\n: side-by-side comparison\n\nAlthough the purposes of React and Angular are different, they are frequently used for the same (or very similar) type of projects, like building a responsive app. Of course, there are benefits in using either of them, and some unavoidable trade-offs. Finding it difficult to choose? Check this React vs. Angular side-by-side comparison.\n\nPerformance\n\nPerformance in React and Angular is more or less quantified in terms of DOMs. DOMs are Document Object Models, which can be real or virtual. React uses virtual DOMs, meaning it does not need to update all the HTML, and only the differences between the new and the old HTML. Angular uses real DOMs and thus it updates the entire HTML. In practice, it means that\n\nReact apps load faster than Angular apps.\n\nBut performance isn’t all about technology, sometimes it’s about methodologies and frameworks, i.e. being Agile. Check our comparison\n\nScrum vs Kanban\n\n.\n\nLearning Curve\n\nAs we’ve seen, Angular uses TypeScript and React uses JavaScript. Although both of these are extremely similar, Angular has a specific structure in terms of using TypeScript and is also a framework on itself that needs to be learned. React is extremely intuitive for developers who already know JavaScript. Overall,\n\nthe learning curve is much steeper in Angular than in React\n\n.\n\nGet to know the\n\nkey principles of app onboarding\n\nfor business users.\n\nScale\n\nReact is aimed mostly at small to medium-scale web applications. Angular, on the other hand, is much better suited for large-scale applications with various features.\n\nAngular is more dependable in terms of scalability than React\n\n.\n\nEase of Use\n\nThis is a tough one. Both Angular and React are user-friendly, however, if we need to compare the two, one will be “friendlier.” In this case, due to the steep learning curve of Angular, together with the faster React documentation and with the fact that Angular is a full-fledged framework, we’d say\n\nReact wins in terms of ease of use, compared to Angular\n\n.\n\nUI Development\n\nWhile you can develop a great UI with Angular, React is UI developer deluxe. So, this is an easy one:\n\nReact is more suited for UI development than Angular\n\n. Wait… are you wondering about\n\ndApp development\n\n? You’ll be happy to know that both React and Angular allow you to build dApps – or decentralized app development – the kind that gets your business on the next generation of the internet, Web 3.0.\n\nCommunity Support\n\nIn terms of community support, while you’d think React would have a larger community support system since it is a JavaScript library and much older than Angular, the truth is the\n\ncommunity support around Angular is much larger and dependable than the one around React\n\n, which consists mainly of the Facebook developers community.\n\nTesting & Debugging\n\nBeing a complete framework, Angular provides complete testing and debugging with a single tool. React, on the other hand, relies on a set of distinct tools to perform different tests.\n\nAngular is better for testing, debugging, and at handling errors than React.\n\nPsst: take a look at\n\n5 cybersecurity threats you may not be aware of\n\n.\n\nSelf-Sufficiency\n\nIn the same line of testing and debugging,\n\nAngular is more self-sufficient than React\n\n. This is because its complete framework eliminates the need for additional libraries, as it comes with much more functionality out-of-the-box, while React requires additional libraries.\n\nFreedom\n\nAnd, of course, the downside of a full framework like Angular compared to a library like React, is that it offers a limited amount of flexibility. React, on the other hand, gives you much more freedom to choose the right tools, libraries, and even architecture for developing an app. In sum,\n\nReact is more flexible than Angular\n\n.\n\nReact vs. Angular\n\n: the verdict\n\nThe question that brought you here is probably “which one to choose?.” While we can’t fully answer without understanding your specific project, we can give you a quick summary of the categories in which one is a “winner.”\n\nBut in the end, the decision of React vs. Angular comes to establishing priorities. Do you prioritise flexibility over completeness? Performance over scale? Ease of use over error handling? You also need to understand what the goals of your choice are. Do you need a large, feature-rich application? Or do you need it to be fast and lightweight?\n\nNeed a Frontend Partner?\n\nAdmittedly, deciding which technology to use for a project involves multiple factors, including analysing the nature of the project, having a solid business plan, and being knowledgeable of the technologies. Luckily, while you bring the project to the table, we can put in the expertise.\n\nIf you need help from frontend developers, be it to\n\nbuild a whole project from scratch\n\n, or an\n\nextended team\n\nto assist your in-house team, don’t look further. Our growing team loves a good challenge because, after all, that is how we become better developers.\n\nLet us know about your ideas, and we’ll brainstorm together to find the perfect solution for your and your business’ needs.\n\nSee which of our\n\nNearshore Solutions\n\nfits your company, or just drop us a line if you are unsure about your business’ specific development needs.\n\nGet in touch\n\nwith Near Partner and get your website or app up and running.",

    "content": "Business Intelligence has long been the data weapon of choice of large corporations.\n\nHowever, innovations in the field are paving the way for businesses of every size to tap into its power.\n\nBut what does it mean exactly?\n\nBusiness Intelligence, or BI, stands out as one of the most effective and widespread tool for businesses looking to extract real value from an ocean of data. Which poses the question: what is it exactly?\n\nWhat is Business Intelligence?\n\nBusiness Intelligence transforms copious amounts of raw data into powerful insights that enable companies to make strategic decisions based on facts. These tools access and analyze data from various sources (inside and outside the company), identify patterns, trends, or inconsistencies. Then, BI software generates reports, dashboards, graphs, and charts to present the analytical findings for decision makers. It provides users with detailed information about the business, which helps create strategic business opportunities.\n\nBut make no mistake: BI is not only about finding trends and generating reports. It makes use of online analytical processing, analytics, data and process mining, dashboard development, complex event processing, benchmarking, text mining, predictive and prescriptive analytics, and business performance management.\n\nWhat BI looks like?\n\nBusiness Intelligence is not exactly new. In fact, it has been reshaping industries for years. Large corporations have long relied on Business Intelligence, Data Analytics and AI to provide a competitive edge.\n\nFor example, financial services use Business Intelligence to perform risk analysis during loan approval processes. It also helps to determine who are the most profitable customers, or which customers should branch managers get in contact with.\n\nAirlines use Business Intelligence to track flight capacity and to set and adjust prices based on demand/availability. The same goes for hotels that rely on BI to gather statistical information on average occupancy and room rates. This helps hotel managers decide when to offer discounts and to whom.\n\nRetailers use Business Intelligence to better manage and plan marketing campaigns, promotion campaigns, and inventory. Manufacturers, on the other hand, receive real-time analysis of past and current plant operations, and get help in managing production and distribution. Modern healthcare organizations use BI solutions to diagnose rare diseases, identify vulnerable demographics, and improve patient care. Moreover, BI can help universities and schools monitor student performance, identify students who might need assistance, manage grant attribution, or allocate funds.\n\nIt is a brave new world of information and data, factual decision making and simply better management. And it is not just limited to big corporations. Smaller companies, from startups to SMEs are also taking advantage of the power of data to help in decision making and forecasting. Words like “tech”, “2.0” or “data models” are ubiquitous in industry trends of different fields,\n\nfrom farming\n\nto banking.\n\nWhy is Business Intelligence so important?\n\nOverall, the goal of Business Intelligence is to improve business operations by using relevant data. More concretely, BI is an asset as it can:\n\nOptimize internal business processes.\n\nIncrease efficiency and productivity of operational processes.\n\nImprove decision-making and strategy development.\n\nIdentify market trends\n\nProvide insights into customer behavior and shopping patterns.\n\nTrack sales, marketing, and financial performance\n\nAlert users about data anomalies or other issues that need to be addressed\n\nSet benchmarks based on historical and current data\n\nAnalyze and share data across various departments.\n\nProvide crucial information that promotes improvements and innovation.\n\nWith an in-depth, real-time analysis of your business, Business Intelligence can help you enhance customer service and\n\ndigital experience\n\n, achieve higher sales and new revenues, and gain a competitive edge over competitors.\n\nLearn more about\n\nCustomer-Centric Process Automation\n\n.\n\nOver the years these technologies and applications have evolved to become more user-friendly, intuitive, and visual. Non-technical business can rely on BI to gather, store, access, analyze, and interpret data.  However, some businesses still struggle to deploy Business Intelligence.\n\nWhy BI projects fail?\n\nHowever beneficial for companies,\n\nthe harsh reality is that around 80% of BI projects fail\n\n. Why?\n\nReasons why Business Intelligence projects fail\n\nSource:\n\nBI-survey.com\n\nA very common pitfall with using Business Intelligence is regarding it as another “tech project”, rather than as a business or cultural investment. Limiting BI projects to just a handful of tech-savvy users is a recipe for disaster, as key decision makers and users alike are not engaged throughout the development process. As a result, they naturally feel left out and unwilling to adopt a new way of working.\n\nDo you know the\n\ncost of a dream team\n\n?\n\nAnother pitfall is using different tools for different departments, a common issue with legacy systems. This leads to the creation of data silos, where information is not shared or communicated across the organisation. An effective BI strategy depends on the ability to share relevant information for the entire value stream, and having different departments from sales to operations, break down data walls and collaborate efficiently.\n\nFinally, training is crucial. You don’t want to force users to\n\nbecome data engineers overnight\n\n. Training will prove very useful in the long (and even short) run, as all the members will use Business Intelligence towards a common, structured goal: the success of the business.\n\nBusiness Intelligence at Near Partner\n\nWe can advise you on the best approach to your Business Intelligence project. Our team can help you pick the most adequate BI technology, processes to improve, and team capabilities that your project requires. We can also implement, manage and provide training – from the first lines of code to the last dashboard. Don’t miss out on innovation,\n\nget in touch\n\n, and let’s brainstorm together!",

    "content": "When looking for an Agile framework for their dev departments, many companies face a choice: Scrum vs Kanban.\n\nThese are the pros and cons of each option and how to decide.\n\nWhen our customers decide to take the plunge to implement Agile methodologies, the first thing on the to-do list is choosing a winner: Scrum vs. Kanban. These are the main pros and cons of each option. Both Scrum and Kanban are Agile methods. But what does that mean exactly?\n\nWhat is Agile?\n\nIf you have been following us for a while, you already know we are Agile. And you also already know we have our own interpretation of Agile—see\n\nwhat Agile means to us\n\n. Now, this might seem strange, but that is the beauty of Agile: it is not a rigid method. Instead, Agile is mutable and adaptable to every team’s needs. See\n\nhow Agile got us through COVID19\n\n.\n\nThat being said, a small Agile recap:\n\nAgile is a set of practices, processes, and tools used in product creation and project development. It is commonly adopted within, but not limited to, software development. The Agile methodologies and frameworks provide a conceptual structure for project development, by breaking down a large project into smaller tasks. Essentially, Agile is less about software and more about\n\nproblem solving\n\n.\n\nThere are a few important principles in Agile that represent a huge shift in traditional project management:\n\nEarly and continuous delivery of incremental improvements (evolution, not revolution)\n\nWelcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.\n\nBusinesspeople and developers working together daily throughout the project.\n\nFace-to-face conversation, as the most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team.\n\nWorking software is the primary measure of progress\n\nThe best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.\n\nWhat is Scrum?\n\nScrum is an Agile framework. The keyword in understanding Scrum is\n\niteration\n\n. In a nutshell, this is how Scrum works:\n\nA product owner sets up a Backlog—a priority list of all the work needed to develop the product.\n\nThe Scrum Master assigns dev teams (smaller) tasks in the Backlog to be developed in Sprints—a period usually between 1 to 4 weeks.\n\nThe Sprint Backlog goes on a Board and the Scrum Master divides into steps, for example, “To do”, “In progress”, “Blocked”, and “Done”.\n\nDuring the Sprint, there is a daily Scrum (15-minute meeting) where the development team gathers and discusses progress and roadblocks, and how to adjust from there.\n\nAt the end of the Sprint, the Scrum Team and its stakeholders verify the results and adjust for the next Sprint.\n\nRepeat until the project is finished and ready to go.\n\nSounds simple enough, right? Kanban works in a similar way, but with a few vital differences.\n\nWhat is Kanban?\n\nKanban is also an Agile framework and a Japanese word that means “visual board” or “visual sign” . While Kanban is a very visual framework, the keyword here is\n\ncontinuous\n\n.\n\nJust like in Scrum, there is a Backlog with tasks and a Board with steps such as “To do”, “In Progress”, “Test” and “Done”. The dev team selects high priority tasks from the Backlog and into the Board. Every time a task moves along in the Board, another gets pulled into it.\n\nThere are also optional Daily Stand-up meetings, Demos for Stakeholders and Retrospectives.\n\nDaily Scrums and Daily Stand-ups aside, an office tip: experience\n\nthe power of having One-on-Ones\n\n.\n\nScrum vs Kanban: what’s the difference?\n\nBoth Scrum and Kanban are frameworks of the same methodology that start with a Backlog and end with a finished, functional product. However, the entire process in between is quite different.\n\nWhile Scrum is more goal-oriented, structured, and focused, the Kanban approach is more about visualising the entire process from beginning to end.\n\nThese are the differences between Scrum vs Kanban side by side.\n\nIn few words, Scrum is more planned and set than Kanban, which is more relaxed and adaptative. However, note that these “rules” are guidelines rather than actual set-in-stone rules. They’re Agile.\n\nScrum vs Kanban\n\n: what’s the right fit?\n\nNow that you know the basic differences between Scrum vs Kanban, which one is better for you? There is actually not a real definitive answer; It would be like comparing an aeroplane and a boat. It all depends on your business, projects, teams, and goals.\n\nFrom our experience with customers from various industries, Scrum should be your weapon of choice if your business needs a fundamental shift towards a structured and efficient process. On the other hand, if your business already has working, effective processes that you want to improve, then Kanban might be just what you need.\n\nOption three: you are stuck and have no idea which method is right for your business, nor which tool (of the dozens of Scrum or Kanban tools available) you should choose. Then maybe you need a (Near) Partner to guide you through—do you know\n\nhow to choose the right outsourcing partner\n\n?\n\nRegardless.\n\nLet’s talk Agile. Let’s talk Scrum vs Kanban, Jira vs Asana, or even the lovechild of Scrum and Kanban: Scrumban! Yep, project development is\n\nalso\n\nfun.\n\nGet in touch\n\nand let’s get your business up and running at its potential. Meanwhile, check our\n\nProject Cost Simulator\n\n.",

    "content": "Despite much confusion, low-code and no-code are different things.\n\nSo which is the best for you: low-code or no-code?\n\nLow-code and no-code are disrupting the IT scene. Some call it the biggest change since cloud-based software. However, low-code and no-code are frequently lumped together when citizen development comes up. This is not only confusing but wrong, too.\n\nHinting by the names, low-code is not the same as no-code (aka zero-code). In theory, the difference seems to be only in the amount of coding, right? But there is more than meets the eye, literally.\n\nWhat is low-code?\n\nLow-code is a visual software development approach that requires minimal coding in order to build applications and other software.\n\nInstead of using complex programming languages, most low-code platforms rely on intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces targeted at both qualified software developers and citizen developers alike. Ever heard of\n\nOutsystems\n\n?\n\nLow-code serves a range of different needs, from simple apps for automation or\n\nto improve workflow\n\n, to more complex apps and tools that ultimately become mission critical for business processes. Learn\n\nhow enterprise-grade low code can reduce time-to-market\n\n.\n\nThe major benefits of low-code are speed, agility and collaboration. Low-code platforms allow for scalable architectures, open APIs for reusability, cloud development and on-premises deployment.\n\nSo why do so many choose low-code? Because it allows for developers to take control over every aspect of an app – from quality testing to UX/UI. It also streamlines collaboration between IT and business users.\n\nLow-code’s use cases. Source:\n\nTheNewStack\n\nLearn more about\n\nwhat you can build with low-code platforms\n\n.\n\nWhat is no-code?\n\nNo-code is also a visual software development approach. But unlike low-code, it requires zero coding. Who uses no-code? Mostly departments within an organisation that need simple, stand-alone apps to improve workflow. For example, it is useful if a business needs an app to serve specific department needs, but does not have an IT team or the existing team can’t really devote themselves to it. No-code platforms offer a user-friendly interface with drag-and-drop capabilities and pre-built templates. Its primary advantage is that it allows for the fast creation of apps and tools without a single line of code.\n\nWith no-code platforms, it is possible to build\n\nBusiness Intelligence\n\nreporting and dashboards, automate business process, and create data management applications, as well as migrate data from legacy systems. A very simple example of an application that can be created with no-code is a tool for automated invoicing.\n\nHowever, the downsides of no-code become more important as the company grows. No-code can lead to shadow IT, which can compromise security, compliance, integration, lead to resource depletion, and increase\n\ntechnical debt\n\n. And crucially, no-code’s simplicity can also be its downfall. Pre-built models and templates are great at the start of development, but its rigidity soon caps the possibility of scalability and customization.\n\nLow-code vs. no-code\n\n: what are the differences?\n\nBasically, no-code can be seen as a subset of low-code. Meaning, low-code offers some no-code tools and functionalities, but the opposite is not true. Do you know\n\nwhat to look for in an app development software\n\n? Let’s look at a summarized comparison low-code vs no-code:\n\nIn short, both low-code and no-code allow businesses to create applications with greater efficiency, increasing productivity. However, the two have different purposes. Therefore, there isn’t a direct answer to the initial question (“Which is best?”) when it comes to low-code vs no-code.\n\nLow-code is the better choice for developing mobile and web apps and portals that require integration with other systems and several data sources\n\n. For simple applications that don’t really require customization, no-code is the better option.\n\nLow-code, admittedly, is not as simple as no-code. To make the most out of a low-code platform, you will need some intervention by a developer at some point. However, there is still enough simplicity in low-code tools to get apps up and running much\n\nfaster than via traditional, hand-coded, development\n\n.\n\nAnd, since low-code still requires some knowledge of coding, security risks or compliance issues aren’t as common as with no-code, as trained developers are up to par.\n\nWhat will your choice be?\n\nAlthough the differences and similarities are laid out above, it can still be difficult to choose between low-code vs. no-code.\n\nDoes your organisation not have a dedicated IT department but would still need a customizable and scalable app? Or is your IT team completely swamped and unable to assist other departments with a low-code solution? We can help you assess your company’s needs. Check\n\nwhat an extended team is and why you might need one\n\n.\n\nDo you need a simple yet effective no-code platform to automate complex tasks and processes? We can also advise you on how to proceed.

    "content": "Data analytics is a must-have for any business looking to grow.\n\nThis is what it means and why it is so important.\n\nWith the rapid development of business and information technologies, the word data gained an additional dimension.\n\nData analytics\n\n, data science or Big Data are on everyone’s lips. But why, exactly?\n\nOver the last decade, the overall amount of data created worldwide has been increasing year after year. In 2010, there were around 2 zettabytes, or two trillion gigabytes, of data in the entire world. By 2017, this number was 26ZB, and by the end of 2020, 64ZB.\n\nThe size of the Global Datasphere\n\nSource:\n\nForbes\n\nEstimates suggest that 2021 closed with 79ZB of data (information) created, captured, copied, and consumed worldwide. This number will most likely more than double by 2025, and there is really no end in sight. And if zettabytes confuse you, think something like one zettabyte is the same as having one billion 1TB hard drives.\n\nIt is safe to say the world is becoming more data driven. Companies generate, collect and store copious amounts of data, but struggle to put it to the best possible use. This is where Data analytics comes in.\n\nWhat is Data analytics all about?\n\nData analytics is a discipline whose goal is to extract insights from data. Collecting, organizing, storing, and managing data are all critical tasks but there is more to Data Analytics. Much more.\n\nThis concept comprises all the processes, tools, and techniques used to apply statistical analysis on data, in order to find trends and patterns and draw conclusions.\n\nData analytics vs. Data Science vs. Big Data\n\nBig Data refers to the data that is too large, too fast, and/or too complex to be processed by traditional systems and methods. It is used in customer, compliance, fraud and operational analytics, where large amounts of disparate data need to be collected and analyzed.\n\nData science and data analytics might sound the same but aren’t. In short, data science is the discipline that pulls data together to create questions; data analytics is the discipline that uses data to answer them.\n\nTo illustrate, search engines use data science algorithms to deliver the best results in Internet searches. Data analytics can be of use in healthcare to track and optimize patient flow, treatment, outcomes, or even equipment used in hospitals.\n\nThe four types of Data analytics:\n\nThere are the four basic types:\n\nDescriptive analytics:\n\nuses historical and current data from multiple sources to identify trends and patterns.\n\nDiagnostic analytics:\n\nuses data to understand what factored in or caused good or bad past performances.\n\nPredictive analytics:\n\nuses techniques such as statistical modelling, forecasting, and machine learning to make predictions.\n\nPrescriptive analytics:\n\nessentially uses testing and other techniques to recommend solutions that help achieve desired outcomes.\n\nData analytics\n\n: how and why?\n\nData analytics is a set of processes that allow businesses to extract insights from data. Every project is different, but the application usually follows these three steps.\n\nThe preparation\n\nThe first step is to understand what data is needed (for example, qualitative or quantitative), how it is grouped (by age, demographic, and so on), and what are the expected requirements.\n\nThen comes the stage of collecting data. There are a lot of potential sources of data (isn’t everything a potential source?) like websites, blogs, online shops, cameras, environment, through customers themselves or through personnel.\n\nOnly then can companies organize data and make it ready to be analysed. Think spreadsheets as the most basic tool, but it can be any other software that can take and handle statistical data.\n\nFinally, to wrap up the Preparation stage, it is essential to do a thorough clean-up. After all, the output of Data Analytics is only as good as the quality of its input. So, the data needs to be cleaned up, corrected of errors, duplication or incompleteness.\n\nThe Analysis\n\nThis is where the four types of Data Analytics come in. To do so, and depending on the type, format and purpose of the data, the data analyst may use one or several methods, such as:\n\nRegression analysis:\n\nit is used to understand how variables affect one another. For example, how are marketing campaigns affecting sales?\n\nCohort analysis:\n\nused to divide datasets into smaller groups with common characteristics or cohorts. This is useful to, for example, understand customer segments.\n\nFactor analysis\n\n: a statistical method for breaking down large datasets and finding hidden patterns. A potential use case is understanding customer loyalty.\n\nCluster analysis:\n\na technique used in machine learning for finding similarities between data and grouping it in clusters. Commonly used for email marketing to identify consumers who use email in similar ways and then tailor the emails sent to different clusters of customers.\n\nTime series analysis\n\n: used to identify trends, cycles, and systemic patterns in specific time intervals. Frequently used in automated stock trading, but also interest rates, quarterly sales and sales forecasting.\n\nMonte Carlo simulations:\n\nvery used in, for example, physics. Monte Carlo is a statistical method used to model complex probabilities. Risk analysis is one of its biggest applications.\n\nSentiment analysis:\n\nuses tools such as natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, AI, etc., to analyse qualitative data. It is relevant for social media monitoring, brand monitoring, customer support, customer feedback analysis, or market research. For example, brands can use it to detect the tone used in social media comments.\n\nLearn\n\nwhy human centric process automation is so important.\n\nThe Results\n\nBut what is the point of these methods, tools, and techniques?\n\nData analytics exists at the intersection of information technology, statistics, and business. No wonder it is so used in\n\nBusiness Intelligence\n\nand across all industries to help businesses optimize performance. Implementing Data analytics means your company can actively use the data that is currently not being analysed to improve operations, increase revenue, and reduce costs by identifying more efficient ways of doing business.\n\nBut the use of it goes beyond maximizing profits and ROI. Ultimately, the insights obtained through Data Analytics help business make better decisions, which can lead to further growth and development, or even new opportunities.\n\nPlanning Data analytics\n\nImplementing phase starts with a plan. What if you don’t have a plan yet, but more like an idea? You came to the right place. We can help you with the choice of platform and tools, navigate the metrics, meet the demand for mobile data accessibility, and comply with regulations.\n\nData analytics is fast becoming a fundamental part of any business plan. Digital data is everywhere, from social media to mobile sources. It just needs to be put to good use.\n\nAt Near Partner, we have a wonderful Data Analytics team, lead by\n\nFilipe Sá, our Head of Data Analytics\n\n. And we’re ready to collaborate with you and get the best solutions for your business. Let’s brainstorm and accelerate your business together:\n\nget in touch\n\n!",

    "content": "cybersecurity threats and a global pandemic are pressuring the banking\n\nsector to adapt and fast. Here is how banks worldwide are using low-code automation to do just that.\n\nTraditionally, banking has always relied heavily on manual and paper-based processes. But then, two years ago, our lives got turned upside down. One minute, life was normal, and with very little notice, everything went forcibly digital and remote. Suddenly, trips to the bank or even to ATMs were no longer a given, nor part of everyone’s daily lives. Banks, like every other company, had to adjust and adapt.\n\nGoing digital-first in the banking sector\n\nDigital transformation in the banking sector\n\nis hard. Moving from paper to digital is a challenge, especially in such a short time.\n\nBut the issue wasn’t as much going digital, as many retail banks already offered some kind of package for online or home banking. The actual goal is to go digital-first: before, mostly young customers preferred online banking. Now, virtually every customer needed it.\n\nHow much do banks spend on IT?\n\nSource:\n\nForbes\n\nTo truly be on top of the change, banks and financial institutions also need to bring innovation into the table. This meant retail banks needed to make digital banking rapid, agile, customisable, and transparent. And this is where low-code automation played (and still plays) a crucial role.\n\n5 ways banks are leaning on low-code automation\n\nIt is undeniable that the banking landscape has changed, and by the looks of it, permanently. Retail banks need to be more agile in order to compete with so-called “neobanks”, that have come strong with improved apps, more online services, and extreme changes in customer support.\n\nLuckily, traditional banks can rely on low-code automation to speed up the transition, as there are already several low-code platforms directed at banking. See\n\nwhat you can build with low-code platforms\n\n.\n\nHow is low-code automation transforming the banking landscape?\n\n1.\n\nFaster loan application, processing, and disbursement\n\nIf you have applied for a loan in the “before days”, you probably know what we mean when we say applying for a loan, from the customer’s viewpoint, is excruciating. Dozens of papers and signatures for this and that, several weeks to get approval, and countless trips to the bank meanwhile.\n\nFrom the bank’s viewpoint, it is not better either. Loans normally entail manual or semi-manual processing, management, scheduling and disbursement- a several-person job. With low-code automation, the entire process can be simplified, from the loan application form to the qualification criteria verification, not even mentioning risk assessment, where tens of factors come into play. A faster loan application also entails larger processing capacity. It’s a win-win for business and customer.\n\n2.\n\nPaper-free document movement\n\nUsually, document movement between branches or from a branch to the head office will take somewhere between a couple of business days to even a couple of business weeks. During this time, what happens in the background, i.e., while the customer waits, is the physical relocation of said documents, processing, analysing, verification, as well as communication of the different process stages. Low-code automation can reduce business days to minutes or even seconds.\n\n3.\n\nEnhanced fraud detection\n\nFraud is a big deal in banking and other financial services. According to a recent report by Booz Allen Hamilton, anti-money laundering analysts typically employ 75% of their time in data collection. With 15% spent on data entry and organisation, only 10% of an analyst’s time is devoted to analysis. Using low-code automation, it is possible to relay repetitive yet important tasks to software, freeing human skills to where they are most needed –\n\nsuch as data analytics\n\n.\n\n4.\n\nContact and support centre optimisation\n\nWe don’t need to point out how important customer support is in banking, but if we did, we’d say it is vital. People like quick and accurate answers when money is involved. Using low-code automation, banks can quickly and seamlessly implement chatbots that handle routine queries related to bank statements and transactions. Inquires that require decision making are escalated to the human customer support team. A simple triage in traffic can make the difference between unsatisfying and stellar customer experience-it\n\nis the power of Human Centric Process Automation\n\n.\n\n5.\n\nStreamlined mobile everything\n\nNowadays, the norm is mobile banking. Money transfers, consulting bank statements, loan repayments, and so on, are all done via mobile, and we expect apps to work flawlessly. For this, a banking app needs to be quickly and safely updatable, upgradeable, and obviously scalable. From the customer viewpoint, ease of use and simple and visual interfaces are two key aspects as well. Low-code and low-code automation can help banks and financial services deliver functional and easily customisable native mobile apps fast that cater to customer needs.\n\nIn summary, low-code automation provides banking with the agility, scalability, and speed they need to improve operations, while reinforcing security and compliance. The results are happier customers, reduced operational costs, and improved productivity.\n\nLow-code automation\n\nis leading change\n\nIf you are still unsure of how low-code automation can totally change banking, this is the right place. At Near Partner we’ve welcomed low-code development with open arms, and we understand the reservations a traditionally conservative business, such as banking, might have when embracing digital transformation. Is it secure? Is it intuitive? How can change happen seamlessly? These and many more questions were once in the minds of all our now very satisfied customers who have partnered up with us. However, to succeed in today’s decentralised work environment, one needs to embrace change as it comes. And those who have, are thriving.\n\nGet in touch\n\nwith Near Partner and let us figure out how we can help you and your business start, grow, or adapt to the digital world. Even better, let’s discover it together. Look at some\n\nsuccess stories of partnerships with Near Partner\n\n. Meanwhile, check our\n\nProject Cost Simulator",

    "content": "Cyber security has never been so relevant as it is in this post-Covid era.\n\nBut are you aware of all the threats your business faces every day?\n\nCybersecurity is on everyone’s lips. And for good reason.\n\nCyber security threats are getting increasingly more sophisticated – and damaging. As people have their whole lives online, a security breach opens the door to data thefts or confidentiality violations. We’re talking banking info, social security data, tax declarations, or medical records, just to name a few.\n\nThese are the 5 key security threats you may not know about.\n\n5 security threats to watch out for in 2022\n\nApart from the widely known cyber security threats like phishing, malware viruses, or third-party software, there are others that target mostly businesses with devastating consequences.\n\n1.\n\nIoT vulnerabilities\n\nInternet of Things (IoT) devices are used to collect data and communicate it across systems which are, in effect, data providers. This paints a target on their back for attacks where sensitive data is accessed and used to compromise other connected systems. To make matters worse, IoT devices are vulnerable because they lack the necessary built-in security controls to defend against cyber security threats.\n\nThat is precisely what happened at St. Jude Medical where transmitter vulnerabilities caused an implantable cardiac to be hacked. Thanks to quick thinking, the team identified and fixed the vulnerabilities. But should hackers have gotten to it first, they could have gotten control of the device potentially harming the patients, for example, by administering incorrect dosages of medicine.\n\n2.\n\nCredential stuffing\n\nCredential stuffing happens when credentials from one data breach are used to access other unrelated services. This is a consequence of the combination of sophisticated bots that can simultaneously attempt several logins from different IP addresses, and customers that reuse their passwords across several platforms.\n\nThis is one of the biggest cyber security threats businesses and customers face. It is also why so many businesses are implementing multi-factor authentication, password-less authentication, or user behavior analytics. Social media, email services and email-based services are some of the most common targets.\n\n3.\n\nMan in the middle\n\nA man in the middle (MITM) attack involves a third party intercepting a communication or transaction between two other parties, stealing the information being shared, and then using the stolen data for other purposes.\n\nPercentage growth in 2020 data breaches compared to 2019. Source:\n\nkroll\n\nA MITM attack usually involves using a fake security certificate that appears as a legitimate web service and bypasses browser security settings. For example, when accessing a banking website from an insecure network, such as a public wi-fi network, a hacker could exploit a vulnerability in the system, interrupt the traffic, and steal passwords and other banking data.\n\n4.\n\nDenial of service\n\nA Denial of Service (DoS) attack happens when an attacker disrupts a network’s normal traffic by overloading it, rendering it unable to respond. When such an attack affects simultaneously multiple devices or systems, it is called a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. A common DDoS is a DNS attack, where users enter what they think is a trusted address and are redirected to malicious websites because the DNS server is compromised.\n\nDoS and DDoS attacks normally take advantage of the system overload, which makes it more vulnerable to attacks to enter the network or environment.\n\nUkraine was a recent victim of a mass DDoS attack that took down several government websites in February and affected banks as well. Later it was discovered that a “wiper” malware had been implanted in thousands of machines across Ukraine.\n\n5.\n\nCloud breaching\n\nWith many organizations transitioning to cloud-based systems, more and more threats target cloud security. The top cloud vulnerabilities include improper management of RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol), misconfiguration, weak authentication, weaknesses in cloud deployment and shadow IT that give hackers access to assets and sensitive data of companies.\n\nFor example, in 2020, cloud service provider Blackbaud got tangled in a huge lawsuit after being hacked and millions of users getting their bank details stolen.\n\nHow to protect your business and your customers\n\nThe best way to protect your business and your customers’ data from cyber security threats is to prevent data breaches. And preventing data breaches needs commitment from the entire team.\n\nBack up data\n\nBacking up all your business’s digital data is imperative. You should do it regularly and via multiple back-up methods. A good backup system typically includes end-of-week, quarterly and yearly server back-ups, as well as daily backups to a cloud service. To be on the safe side, check and test regularly that you can restore the data from the backups. When using cloud storage, use encryption to transfer and store your data and multi-factor authentication for access.\n\nSecure devices and network\n\nTo keep your devices and network secure, the very basics are to make sure software updates to avoid security flaws, to invest in security software with anti-virus, anti-spyware and anti-spam filters. It is also important to set up a firewall on all your portable business devices, and to turn on your spam filters, reducing the amount of spam and phishing emails.\n\nEncrypt sensitive information and communications\n\nTo encrypt your business’ stored and sent online data, turn on network encryption through router settings or via a virtual private network (VPN). Encrypting data reduces the risk of theft, destruction or tampering.\n\nEducate and train your staff\n\nTo stay compliant and protected, start with your staff. Provide regular training in order to educate them on keeping good passwords and pass-phrases, identifying and avoiding cyber threats, and on what to do when they encounter a cyber security threat and how to report it.\n\nConduct regular audits\n\nRegular audits to assess the cyber protection of your business will ensure that the system you have in place works well, identifying any weaknesses and responding appropriately. Remember: it is always better to know how your system will react beforehand. Do not wait until you need it, as with a data breach.\n\n(Cyber) Security comes first\n\nWe’ve used the word “hacker” often and maybe this paints an image of a single person, human, Mr. Robot-style, behind a computer, trying to hack into your network. Well, the truth is most day-to-day hackers are not persons but bots, sophisticated ones, that can identify and exploit several vulnerabilities at the same time. This makes them so dangerous and effective.\n\nDo you and your business need cyber security advice or guidance on how to avoid or minimize cyber security threats? You are in the right place. At Near Partner we take cyber security seriously, given we work with all kinds of businesses, all over the world. We can help you identify potential security weaknesses and advise you on what kind of solution fits your business’ needs.\n\nGet in touch\n\nwith us, and let’s find the best cyber security solution for your business.

    "content": "The birth of a start-up or project is always a moment of joy. However, putting together a\n\ncoding dream team can be an unwelcomed dose of reality. These tips can guide managers through the key challenges.\n\nStarting a project is exciting, exhilarating, and often frantic. There is so much to consider, so many steps to go through and, more often than not, time constraints to overcome. One of the most burdensome aspects is finding the perfect coding team. That’s because, in the initial stages of the process, it might be difficult to envision what kind of help, skills, and expertise projects will require in the short and long haul. I should know… I’ve been through these challenges many times.\n\nHow much does a “coding dream team” cost?\n\nAccording to Stack Exchange’s 2020 Developer Survey, in which nearly 65,000 people took part, these are the global average salaries of several tech professionals:\n\nGROSS ANNUAL SALARY, 2020\n\nSource:\n\nStack Overflow\n\nThe average annual salaries range from 38k to 95k US dollars – a big difference, especially for start-ups.\n\nTo make things even more complicated, there are several other considerations to keep in mind when putting together a technical team for your business, other than average salaries.\n\nWhat comes into the calculation?\n\nSince each project, organisation and start-up is unique—and so are their needs—it is impossible to predict exactly how much a coding dream team will cost without first analyzing the company and the project. However, there are many factors that come into play—or should we say, into pay—and that will impact the total cost of a team.\n\nHow many people do you need?\n\nThis one is pretty straightforward: the more elements in your team, the more it will cost. It’s quite simple. Assuming your project is just starting, you won’t need a technical team with half-a-dozen elements to get your game plan started. Or maybe you will. The trick is to understand what each of those people will need to do, and which tasks each one of them will be responsible for. Remember that old HR formula: performance = ability x motivation x clarity of roles.\n\nWhat specific skills do you need?\n\nPiggybacking on the previous topic, you will need to figure out what you require from each of your hires. Most developers specialize in at least one programming, scripting or markup language, and there are many, many of them. While some are largely popular, like JavaScript, HTML/CSS or SQL, others are more of a niche like Assembly, Rust or Clojure, for example. Moreover, do you need an engineer or a data scientist? Do you need a frontend or a full-stack dev? Expertise, experience, and skills add up to the cost of a hire.\n\nWhere are these hires located?\n\nRemote work is quite frequent within IT and that has obvious advantages and disadvantages. The biggest pro of remote work for an employer is the access to a larger talent pool. However, the average salaries listed above vary from country to country. For example, the\n\naverage annual salary of a Software Developer in Switzerland\n\nis around 90k dollars, and in neighbour Italy that cost comes down to around 30k. Working hours also vary, as well as language skills, which could add extra costs when hiring.\n\nWhat benefits will you be offering?\n\nTo attract the best talent, organizations need to be an attractive employer. This means possibly health insurance, childcare benefits, wellness programs, education support, commuter benefits – anything that is considered a “bonus” that contributes to employees’ wellbeing and satisfaction. However, these perks obviously cost companies money.\n\nWhat software and hardware will be necessary?\n\nWith IT projects, your employees will need certain software and hardware, with the company bearing the cost. Think frameworks, app development software (and this is\n\nwhat you should look for in one\n\n),\n\nlow-code platforms\n\n, hardware budgets and, of course, laptops or desktops, among many others. But also more office space, which means rent and utilities.\n\nHow much tax will you pay?\n\nFinally, employment taxes can represent a heavy chunk of an employee’s cost for your company. You will need to research how much will the tax associated with a full- or part-time employee add on to the base salaries.\n\nThe bottom line is creating a technical team is something you need to think through. Costs add up easily and a wrong choice can be potentially devastating for a young business—have you heard of\n\ntechnical debt\n\n? But, despite this, your business still needs IT services, so how to go around this?\n\nWhat about outsourcing?\n\nOutsourcing is becoming more popular by the second, and for good reasons. IT outsourcing provides businesses an “extra set of hands” for their development team, but it is also helpful for organizations who are looking to build a solution from scratch.\n\nOutsourcing is quite the flexible solution because it enables companies to “source” the talent that best fits their needs right now – and adapt in the future. Near Partner is a boutique software house, which means we employ experienced professionals, who are also specialists in diverse programming languages and areas. But we also contribute to the culture of the companies we serve, by making your mission our own, and by sharing values and goals. You can choose the duration of our partnership, how much support you’ll need afterwards, and select the way of work that best suits your organization:\n\nExtended Team\n\n. Add highly skilled developers to your team without the hassle of recruitment and retention. Our extended team model expands your in-house staff. Our primary contribution is to add competency, both business and technical, to bridge the skills gap in your core staff.\n\nManaged Team\n\n.

    "content": "The days of analogue agriculture are gone, and technology is changing the world of farming for the better. Welcome to the era of farm tech 2.0.\n\nThere are, pretty much, two images that are associated with farming: either the stereotypical simple folk farmer in the countryside, going about their day in a sturdy old tractor, or the money-hungry corporations that exploit land and people with their aggressive farming techniques and toxic pesticides.\n\nBut a new breed of startups and tech-savvy farms are tackling stereotypes head-on. After years of plowing the farm tech field, the future of agriculture belongs to entrepreneurs able and willing to revolutionize one of the oldest occupations in the world.\n\nFarm tech 2.0 is here and has limitless potential. But what is it exactly?\n\nWhat’s farm tech?\n\nFarm tech refers to the technologies used in agriculture. But what does the “2.0” entail? Farm tech 2.0 is nothing more than the newest, most innovative agriculture technologies being developed. This seismic shift adds environmental concerns to the productivity goals of new tech, to form a more comprehensive view of agricultural innovation. Farm Tech 2.0 is far from academical. If a few decades ago, farmers would have been told that AI, machine learning and robots could improve temperature and moisture sensors, aerial images, watering systems, or disease detection, they’d have laughed. But tell it to a modern farmer today, and they’ll double down and explain how this will not only increase yields but also ensure high quality and increased market value.\n\nFarm tech comprises the tools and machinery employed in agriculture, as well as the software and techniques that keep being developed and improved. Farm tech 2.0 is the lovechild of agriculture and high tech—and we’re excited!\n\nWhy? What’s the fuss all about?\n\nSome examples of farm tech are hydroponics, vertical farming, weather forecasting and tracking, soil and moisture monitoring sensors, GIS software and GPS agriculture, gene editing technology, cellular agriculture, and so on. Sound weird? Remember that the plow, invented around 5000 years ago in Egypt, probably also sounded weird, and still revolutionized agriculture. Same with fertilizers and, later, with biotechnologies.\n\nSource:\n\nwww.oliverwyman.com\n\nFarm tech helps agriculture become more efficient, safer, more profitable, and much more environmentally friendly. This will affect the prices, availability, safety, and quality of food, as well as the environmental and ecological impact. The UN and the FAO recognize that “agricultural technology will have a beneficial impact on and a key role in the successful implementation of the goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, namely increasing food security, promoting sustainable agricultural practices, enhancing crop productivity, and even fighting climate change.\n\nSo, that’s a very justified fuss.\n\nThe trends in farm tech 2.0 that are changing the world\n\nAI and ML\n\nare making their way into our daily lives quick and swiftly. And the same goes for agriculture. Farm tech is growing into its 2.0 version, and is about to rely more heavily on AI, ML, blockchain and data collection to make agriculture more sustainable, environment friendly, profitable, and efficient. These are the key trends revolutionizing farm tech:\n\n1. Aerial imaging\n\nAerial imaging using drone technology and satellite imaging is becoming a go-to in farm management. Farm tech such as this allows farmers to monitor crop variations and potential problems more efficiently than from the ground. This, allied with agriculture apps, makes field monitoring much easier, not only increasing profits but also ensuring more sustainability in farming.\n\n2. Intelligent crop planning\n\nCrop planning involves leveraging AI and remote sensing to identify best sowing windows, to analyze and optimize sowing areas, to track crop progress, or map irrigation, to name a few. AI within agriculture is also being used to provide insights on crop varieties, diseases, or even to predict which crops will deliver the highest returns. That means not only sparing resources and making their usage more efficient but also saving costs and unnecessary expenses, or even avoiding food loss.\n\n3. Smart farming\n\nWhile IoT devices may not sound exactly like farm tech, such technology is extremely useful in an agricultural context. But how? The easiest, most straightforward answer is sensors. Intelligent farming uses light, humidity, moisture, temperature, or pH sensors, among others. Some prime use-cases of IoT in farm tech are data collection by farm sensors like wearables, button cameras, robotics, or control systems, geo fencing via IoT sensors combined with livestock tracking, or predictive analytics for weather—rainfall, temperature, humidity.\n\nSource: Freepik\n\n4. Precision agriculture\n\nPrecision agriculture, although not a new concept, is still a priority for farm tech. It is based on using precise amounts of water, fertilizer, pesticides, for example, at the correct time in order to increase the productivity of the crop and maximize yields. It relies heavily on intelligent planning and smart farming.\n\n5. Data integration\n\nIn a data-driven world, data-driven agriculture makes sense. High volumes of data on costs, weather, soil type, and even markets can and will improve farming methods, as well as help farmers’ decision process. Farm tech relies on data integration to make it easier for farmers to make real-time decisions and adjustments, a pillar for sustainability.\n\n6. Weather forecasting & climate-smart harvesting\n\nThe Farmer’s Almanac has given North American farming a lot of good predictions in over two centuries, but nowadays weather forecasting is more about in-field sensors that allow for real-time accurate readings of wind, rainfall, and temperature. If combined weather forecasting data management, farmers have the farm tech 2.0 they need to optimize processes like spraying, irrigating, harvesting windows, and so on.\n\n7. Blockchain in food supply\n\nAnd finally, blockchain is improving communication among farmers, markets, and consumers, namely in the food supply chain. This can solve some problems that prevail in food safety, quality, traceability, or food supply chain inefficiency.\n\nPartner up to get your project out there\n\nThe modern farmer is not only tech savvy but makes use of a handful of apps to optimize farming, maximize profits and improve sustainability. From weather monitoring or field mapping apps directly on smartphone, to AI-powered software, farm tech is changing agriculture by the minute.\n\nThinking about jumping onto the farm tech ship, and need help with your next project? Let’s talk about it!\n\nAt Near Partner we’re a\n\ndiverse team of developers\n\nwith several areas of expertise, and we’re ready to collaborate with you and get the best solutions for your business, be it smart apps or AI tools, or even a cool sensor.

We have answers.\n\nOutSystems grew quite popular in business, and the software development world followed, as developers are turning more and more to OutSystems. The pressing questions are:\n\nwhat is an OutSystems developer?\n\n,\n\nif OutSystems is lowcode, why are OutSystems developers needed?\n\n, and\n\nwhat does an OutSystems developer do?\n\n.\n\nPhew, these are loaded questions. Fortunately, Near Partner has quite a few OutSystems developers, and we have answers.\n\nFirst, let’s recap about OutSystems: OutSystems is a pioneer\n\nlowcode development platform\n\n.\n\nAs an enterprise-grade software, OutSystems is especially useful in business contexts. Know more about OutSystems\n\nhere\n\n.\n\nHow OutSystems is positioned in an enterprise ecosystem. Source:\n\nOutSystems.com\n\nSecond, the job of an OutSystems developer is to create, build, and maintain OutSystems applications.\n\nEasy, right? Not exactly. Becoming an OutSystems developer requires specific skills and capabilities.\n\nThinking like an OutSystems developer\n\nThe mindset of an OutSystems developer is one of their most important assets. It is a ‘must’ to have an “outside-the-box” approach to development-cheesy, but true.\n\nCheck the\n\ndifferences between traditional and lowcode development\n\n.\n\nTo thrive in such a complex yet flexible environment such as OutSystems, a developer need to be: a)\n\nsolutions-oriented\n\nand b)\n\na\n\nproblem-solver\n\n. Finding solutions and solving problems requires creativity and quite a great deal of abstraction.\n\nIn short, if you ask an OutSystems developer what their job is, the answer will most likely be “To deliver (functional) solutions to my client”. Which is easier said than done.\n\nAn OutSystems developer is someone who can and will use and explore several tools to achieve a desired outcome instead of focusing on the path to get there. Some would call them rule-breakers. We call them people who get things done.\n\nThe skills and technologies that make an OutSystems developer\n\nNow, you must be thinking\n\n“A required skill for an OutSystems developer is… OutSystems”.\n\nAnd you are not wrong, but not totally right either.\n\nThere’s more to OutSystems than meets the eye. Let us guide you through the technical and non-technical skills required of an OutSystems developer to succeed.\n\nThis is the skill set of an OutSystems developer:\n\n1) Software development\n\nJust like any developer, an OutSystems developer must have web development as a skill. Wait, isn’t OutSystems lowcode? Well, yes. But also built on .Net. Meaning that what allows the platform to be lowcode for the business user is, exactly, a lot of code. Traditionally, OutSystems developers are fluent in C# or Java, as well as Python, and/or .Net.\n\n2) SQL\n\nSQL, short for Structured Query Language, is the language used to communicate with relational databases, structured data. Mastery of SQL is an important requirement for any OutSystems developer worth his salt.\n\n3) Mobile development\n\nWhile not everything is mobile, mobile development is essential nowadays, and it has its particular set of considerations. Because of this, it is extremely important a developer has these skills, especially in OutSystems development.\n\n4) Proficiency in web-based languages\n\nHTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP are all web-based languages that are an important part of an OutSystems developer’s baggage. Not understanding how the web works can lead to poor decisions on an OutSystems developer’s part.\n\n5) Soft skills\n\nAnd because any developer is more than a set of technical skills, there is also a requirement for some particular soft skills for an OutSystems developer. One of the most important is flexibility, as well as responsiveness, in changing priorities and concurrent responsibilities. The ability to collaborate with others in a team setting is key to contributing to a successful delivery of large products or projects. Finally, communication-or the ability to communicate clearly and unimpeded with both teammates and other departments-is highly important. See how\n\nsynchronous and asynchronous communication are key for faster development\n\n.\n\n6) Business acquainted\n\nSince OutSystems is an enterprise-grade lowcode platform, it is very useful for an OutSystems developer to be acquainted with the most common business processes and needs. For example, experience with\n\nbuilding proofs of concept\n\nis a highly appreciated plus, as well as experience with participation in full lifecycle development.\n\n7) Agile\n\nThe relationship between OutSystems and Agile is quite obvious. If the concept of Agile is somewhat foreign, look at\n\nwhat it means to us\n\n. Agile values working software over extensive documentation, collaboration over contract negotiation, and responsiveness to change over plans set in stone. And these could very well be the pillars of OutSystems. It’s practically impossible to separate the two, since both lead to\n\nfaster development\n\n, higher engagement, and more visual models. So, yes, OutSystems developers are Agile.\n\nMore: check what are\n\nthe most attractive skills in a Software Engineer according to CIOs\n\n!\n\nEvolving requires adaptable developers\n\nOne thing that makes OutSystems so appealing to developers is that the environment is constantly evolving. This skill set forces developers to evolve too, in their mindset, skill set, and work method. The requirements of an OutSystems developer grow and increase in complexity. Be it because the software or the processes change, or because the business needs shift, making use of the good old adage, the only constant is change.\n\nIn fact, that is one reason OutSystems has such a large and active community of aspiring and established OutSystems developers, Tech Leads, MVPs and Champions (we have\n\nour very own OutSystems Champion, meet André\n\n)!\n\nNeed help with your next OutSystems project? Let’s talk about our\n\nOutSystems services\n\n! At Near Partner, we’re a\n\ncohesive team of developers\n\nwith several areas of expertise, and we’re ready to collaborate with you and get the best solutions for your business.

    "content": "Office meetings, whether online or in-person, are part of the job for many. And even if a company is very “lax”, there’s certain rules of etiquette everyone should always follow. Here’s how to be productive in meetings with 15 time-tested tips.\n\nMeetings with bosses, co-workers, clients, prospects, or team members are a great way to connect, solve issues, prepare for large projects, or even seal deals. However, few enjoy meetings, especially when they happen over a screen. The bad news is we can’t magically make meetings disappear. Sorry. But the good news is that there are\n\n16 golden rules that will help you navigate\n\nthose dreaded work meetings.\n\n1.\n\nPrepare in advance\n\nJust like you would for any meeting. Getting stuck, blank, or confused during a presentation happens most often because of lack of preparation. Come prepared–study the agenda of the meeting beforehand and request any documentation so that everyone has the time to go through it.\n\n2.\n\nBe mindful of others’ time\n\nThey say time is money. However, other people’s time is as important as yours. So, try to be mindful of them by\n\nnot extending meetings longer than necessary\n\n. This also applies to the information shared. During the meeting, avoid wasting people’s time with remarks that aren’t related to the meeting’s topics.\n\n3. Be punctual\n\nYou must have heard “Early is on time; on time is late; and late is inexcusable.” While we don’t know for sure who to attribute this quote to, we suspect it has a British origin.\n\nBeing 5 minutes early for a meeting will hardly disrupt your schedule\n\n, and it will help you make sure you are there when the meeting starts. In a virtual meeting, there are always some problems like not being able to connect or the connection being unstable. Being a tad early will help not to be late because of “unpredictable” glitches.\n\n4. Give notice\n\nIf you can’t make it to the meeting, notify whoever is attending as soon as you can.\n\nLast minute “I can’t make it” is quite embarrassing\n\nand, frankly, nor very professional. Of course, there are always unpredictable situations that might make you late or unable to attend a meeting, but these specific cases aren’t all that common. Be sure to check your calendar and coordinate your time-it is not ok to miss previously agreed upon appointments.\n\n5.\n\nDress, seat and behave accordingly\n\nAlthough online work does not require formal attire (because who is even watching you?), online meetings are a distinct case. Just like you wouldn’t show up to a meeting in your pajamas, with hair all over the place, or slouching like a teenager at the movies, you shouldn’t do it at an online meeting. It is about the\n\nrespect and consideration you show everyone else\n\n. Of course, if it doesn’t show, you most definitely can use your tracksuit bottoms, as long as you dress formally from the waist up.\n\n6.\n\nMind the cultural issues and differences\n\nWhat is acceptable or the norm for\n\npeople in some cultures can be unacceptable for others\n\n. For example, in some cultures, it might be rude to decline coffee, tea or water when offered during an in-person meeting. In online meetings, it is all about behavior, body language, and speech. Pay attention and be respectful of eventual differences.\n\n7.\n\nAvoid political, religious, and cultural comments\n\nOpinions on political, religious, and cultural topics should never, ever, be shared in a work meeting, unless specifically asked of the participants. These are sensitive topics and a simple\n\ncomment, joke, or opinion might derail\n\nan online meeting. The ability to communicate seamlessly across borders is one of the\n\nkey aspects valued by CIOs all over the world\n\n.\n\n8.\n\nBeware of your body language\n\nWe get it, some meetings are really boring. But boring meetings come with the job. Be mindful and sensible of your body language and facial expressions. Particularly, don’t allow yourself to show frustration or anger. Deal with those feelings outside the meeting when you’re calmer.\n\n9.\n\nTurn your video on\n\nFew things are more demoralizing than speaking to a black, silent screen. Keeping your video on, even if the meeting doesn’t require your participation, makes the\n\nother person feel recognized and heard\n\n. But beware that having a messy background with lots happening can be disruptive and distracting. Try to have a solid, neutral background.\n\n10.\n\nHave your real name on screen\n\nDo you know those viral videos of people who used their zoom accounts to have an online get-together with friends, and ended up in a serious work meeting, days later, with the name “PartyBoy_5647”? Don’t be those people.\n\nCheck that you have the right name\n\n, first name and last name, on your avatar before you join the online meeting.\n\n11.\n\nDon’t multitask\n\nAn online meeting is still a meeting. When you’re in the meeting, bring your entire self to it. Focus on the topic being addressed. If you feel you’re not needed and have other work-related, more pressing matters, excuse yourself and leave. Better not be present than to mess up by doing two things at the same time.\n\nGetting productive with it. An online meeting booth is a neat trick.\n\n12.\n\nMute yourself\n\nWe get that while working remotely, you might not have access to a totally silent place, but remember that background noises (even breathing, mind you) are amplified during online meetings by the microphone of your headset or computer.\n\nOnline meeting may be part of the future of work\n\n, but the future needs a better soundtrack.\n\n13.\n\nDon’t eat or snack on camera\n\nWhile drinking water is accepted, drinking other things like coffee or tea might not be. Do clear it your team leader or HR. Eating is rarely ok during a meeting. Even if your camera is off, you should not eat or snack, because you can be asked a question and how embarrassing and unprofessional would it be to have everyone understand you are munching away on a sandwich while in an important work meeting?\n\n14.\n\nSpeak clearly\n\nHow they say, use your outside voice. We know that social anxiety is a thing, but in meetings, you need to make sure everyone can hear you and understand what you are trying to communicate. One way to improve your communication is to practise your talk beforehand. The words will flow better. After all,\n\nwhat is a Salesforce developer without the ability to communicate\n\nclearly?\n\n15.\n\nDon’t interrupt\n\nUnless strictly necessary, do not interrupt someone who is talking. And if you have to, be polite and mindful. A simple “Excuse me for interrupting”\n\nfollowed by an explanation or redirecting\n\nto a certain topic will make the interaction much more polite and less awkward.\n\n16.\n\nIntroduce the participants\n\nIf you are hosting the meeting,\n\nintroduce everyone right at the start\n\n. The attendees will certainly appreciate having a small introduction to everyone, within reason. You don’t need to give a detailed description of the person, but if you are the common link between different parties, try to introduce them by first name and last name, and at least their position in the company.\n\nEven if your boss is always cracking jokes around the office, or your co-worker is an absolute blast at the company’s barbecues, meetings (even online ones) are not social events. These 15  simple pointers on how to be productive in online meetings should help you improve your communication skill set.\n\nLooking for new ways of making your days more productive? At Near Partner,\n\nour team of expert problem solvers\n\nis always looking for creative ways of making the best use of the limited work time at hand. We’ll find ways of simplifying processes, automate repetitive tasks and turn hours into seconds.\n\nGet in touch and see the difference\n\n.",

    "content": "We are sending out a warm welcome to Filipe Sá, our new Head of Data Analytics.\n\nHere’s to a great start and an exciting journey ahead.\n\nTime for another healthy dose of gloating about our people. This time, we called on\n\nFilipe Augusto Sá\n\n, our new Head of Data Analytics, who was happy to share his love of data.\n\nLet us introduce him.\n\nMeet Filipe\n\nFilipe is a loving dad of three, a WWII buff, and a Google Cloud Platform enthusiast. When he’s not busy at home with his family, Filipe looks for new challenges in the world of data. But often, the two worlds collide.\n\n“The first time I explained to my daughter what my job is she was in the car, browsing the internet on her cell phone, and she noticed that there were commercials she liked. Then she asked: ‘Gee, how do they know I like these things?’ I explained to her that Google kept the searches she did and that it ‘learned’ her tastes and then showed her everything related to her previous searches. I took the opportunity and said that this is one thing that my work allowed me to do.”\n\nGrown-ups have a lot of questions about data as well. Such as, what is it exactly? Or, how much is it worth? And what can you do with it?\n\nData Analytics, explained\n\nFilipe offers a simple yet profound definition for his life’s work: “Data Analytics is the exploration of all available data, whether or not structured, to deepen our understanding, extracting knowledge and plan actions that generate results.”\n\nSince Filipe is a die-hard fan of data, we couldn’t help but ask if he could put the value of data into a few big numbers. He definitely could: “Google estimates that humanity has created in the last 5 years, the equivalent of 300 exabytes of data or 300,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes of data. And the production of this data doubles every 2 years. The challenge is knowing how to get the most information out of this data.”\n\nAnd that, according to Filipe, is where most business leaders still struggle. So, how important is data to companies? And what transformations can data bring about to existing businesses? Once again, Filipe answered swiftly\n\nand\n\nwith figures, “6 out of 10 companies founded today will be out of business in 5 years. And the main reason for this is that leadership is not data driven.”\n\nLeading the charge on Data Analytics\n\nFor those businesses that prioritize Data Analytics, the benefits are significant. Pattern identification, greater understanding of activities,\n\nautomated systems\n\n,\n\nand simply better decision making\n\nare just some of the major benefits highlighted by Filipe as he thinks about examples everyone can relate to:\n\n“Netflix, with its predictive analytical models, could define specific characteristics for its new productions, such as genre, plot and cast. They can even predict how many and which users are more inclined to like and consume each release. This way, the company serves various niche audiences, leaving its users satisfied and increasing loyalty to the platform.”\n\nNetflix’s annual revenue from 2002 to 2018\n\nSource:\n\nStatista\n\nAnd big tech companies are not alone in this. “Nike is another example of a company that has realized how to leverage social media data. Nike launched a running app that was widely publicized. Using this application, the brand got important data from the audience and the information needed to improve the products. With more effective data mining, every company can find ‘gems’ (information) that will improve the company’s business even more.”\n\nFilipe is happy to illustrate further, with examples from a well-known logistics provider. “The logistics company UPS (United Parcel Service) began using technology to optimize delivery routes. By cross-referencing vehicle sensor data, map information and customer order requirements, it reduced an incredible 136 million km driven per year.”\n\nBut perhaps the most striking example of the importance of data comes from a traditional brick and mortar retailer. “Before the doors open daily at each of Zara’s 2,213 locations worldwide, employees and managers share details of the previous day, about items returned by customers, feedback from buyers, as well as trends the team has noticed. Analysts release daily updates and use them to paint an accurate picture of exactly what Zara’s customers are demanding. A vast team of over 300 in-house designers quickly translates this information into tangible projects that comply with fashion trends, and, in 21 days, the new item is available for sale. While most fast-fashion brands try to anticipate what customers want, Zara wins the trend by getting customer feedback.”\n\nSurely, large organizations like Nike are better poised to reap the benefits of data mining? Not so fast, cautions Filipe. “Nowadays, because of competition and the growing digital world, a company can only grow and consolidate if it is based on data. For a company starting today, my advice is to take good care of your data, for it can be the major factor that drives failure.”\n\nWhere is Data Analytics headed?\n\nWith all the buzz around Data Analytics, it is easy to mistake the major trends for flights of fancy. For Filipe, however, his priorities are clear, and the future is already here.\n\n“About 90% of all data in existence was generated in the last 2 years and it doubles every 2 years. So the ideal is to think about the ‘future’ right now, as the number of companies with the presence of Data Analytics platforms is increasing. Especially those who want more assertive information from Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, or even both together for a better understanding of the data.”\n\nA\n\nGartner study backs Filipe’s conclusions\n\n. According to the report, data and analytics are quickly shifting to become a core function. However,\n\nbusiness leaders often underestimate the complexities of data\n\nand end up missing opportunities. If chief data officers (CDOs) are involved in setting goals and strategies,\n\nthey can increase the production of business value by a factor of 2.6 times.\n\nThe reality for most business users today, however, is still pre-defined dashboards, manual data mining and excel sheets. Filipe says this can lead to incorrect conclusions, faulty decisions, and actions. “Time spent on dashboards will be progressively replaced as users’ needs are addressed with automated insights and dynamically generated customized through a pre-defined dashboard.”\n\nDigital transformation\n\nrequires increasingly faster and more assertive information. But to make the most of these opportunities, you need a skilled Data Analyst. But what does that mean exactly?\n\nWhat does a Data Analyst do?\n\nWe talked about what is Data Analytics and its importance, but we wanted to go deeper into what a Data Analyst actually does and it what it takes to become one.\n\n“You need to be curious and creative to be a successful Data Analyst. That’s what allows you to find a diamond in the rough (data) and transform it into a gemstone (Information). For this, he first needs to be curious to understand the data well and be able to transform it into something that can be easily visualized, you also need to be creative, as the way you show results can lead to new insights and create a world of possibilities.”\n\nA successful Data Analytics also needs some hard skills in his or hers tool belt: “Technically, you must have very good analytical power, have expert knowledge of specific programming languages such as SAS, R, Python. I would also highlight the use of BI tools such as Tableau, PowerBI or DataStudio.”\n\nThese soft and hard skills are part of every\n\nproject team here at Near Partner\n\n!\n\nOur approach to a Data Analytics project\n\nWhen you have the data but don’t know what to do with it, it’s worthless. According to Filipe, there are 4 vital steps to any Data Analytics project that will\n\ntransform raw data into useful information\n\n:\n\nDefine the opportunity/need/problem\n\n–At this stage, says Filipe, it is important to ask “What happened? What is the problem? What do I want to find? What is our objective?”\n\nSelect the data\n\n–The next step is to select which data is available inside or outside the organization that could help with the research\n\nSelect the model most adhering to the need\n\n–choosing the most adequate model is a big part of the solution, says Filipe\n\nGenerate reports and dashboards from the analysis\n\n– In this step, the creativity of a Data Analyst is extremely important, because “a well-done report or dashboard can generate insights beyond expectations.”\n\nWorking at Near Partner\n\nLooking for a place to enhance your Data Analyst skills? Filipe came to Near Partner looking “to learn, for new challenges, and to meet an exciting team”.\n\nBut don’t just take Filipe’s word. Jean Lelis has recently joined our team and for him, “the culture is one of continuous development in order to have well-trained, motivated professionals with excellent technical skills”. Indira Sanches highlights what for her makes Near Partner: “I feel I have a voice and that I can contribute to its success.”\n\nNuno Dias breaks down our company culture: “We believe that good people, left at ease to work within the frame of the company’s culture, will do good things for customers, colleagues, and the company. That’s the Near Partner way.”\n\nIf you’d like to know what it feels to work with an expert team in laid-back environment, reach out.\n\nWe have a spot for you.",

    "content": "Technology has and always will take a supporting role to human activity.\n\nSo why isn’t process automation more human-centred?\n\nIn a time of increased pressure to automate everything, here at Near Partner we are taking a step back to reflect on the importance of Humans. Yes, Humans and how process automation should revolve more around us and our needs rather than the current tech fabs or coding languages. For us,\n\neach new challenge is a people project, not a systems project\n\n.\n\nThe rise of process automation\n\nSince the 1960s, process automation has developed greatly,\n\nfrom basic if/then steps to complex analysis and predictive behavior\n\n. These achievements have brought automation to many aspects of our daily lives. Businesses benefited as well – from a reduction of labour costs, increased efficiency and enhanced security.\n\nProcess automation, fuelled by\n\ndigital transformation\n\nhas reduced the human workload, both physical and intellectual, by taking over repetitive and time-consuming tasks. In the meantime, it has also freed up time for human operators to use their cognitive abilities in other, more demanding or creative, tasks.\n\nHow did we get here: The rise of Process Automation\n\nSource\n\nHimanshu D Shah\n\nAs such, system designers have concentrated efforts in\n\nrefining process automation tools\n\n–be it better sensors, more developed algorithms, and so on. However, the more process automation tools evolve, the\n\nmore\n\nimportant the human role is\n\n. And, in this case, a technology-first approach can become counterproductive, as it has little to no regard for human resources.\n\nSo, as automation can take on increasingly complex and intricate tasks, it becomes even more important to adopt a\n\nhuman-centric approach to process automation\n\n, meaning the user should be in the centre, working\n\nwith\n\nthe technology, rather than\n\ndespite\n\nthe technology.\n\nProcess automation with a human-centred approach\n\nA human-centric approach to process automation is much more than\n\njust\n\nusing technologies to automate previously manual tasks. It refers to using automation to promote, enhance and, ultimately, ease\n\nuser effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity\n\n. Human-centred process automation enhances performance and\n\ncompensates for human operators’ limitations\n\n, especially in dynamic and complex systems.\n\nDespite all the menial tasks that, inevitably, are a necessity in any business and any role, there are always some uniquely human tasks which cannot be automated. Qualitative decision-making, report and data reviewing, creating personalised proposals, judging, evaluating, approving, improving, or even authorising certain processes are all tasks that need human intervention. At this level, automation can only do so much.\n\nHuman automated-centric process automation acts as a support to people in these challenging tasks, rather than a separate workflow. The results are much more\n\nflexibility\n\n,\n\nadaptability\n\n,\n\nfaster response\n\nand handling of\n\nexceptional situations\n\n,\n\nerror reduction\n\n, higher rates of\n\ncompliance\n\n, and\n\nbetter communication\n\nwith customers, for example.\n\nHuman-centred process automation live\n\nBut how does human-centred process automation work, in practical terms? In one of our recent projects, a series of workshops (with Humans!) confirmed that the focus for change should not be technology applications, but rather a reduction in manual, repetitive processes that would alleviate pressure on the staff. To achieve this, Robotics Process Automation (RPA) was recommended.\n\nHumans and machines go hand-in-hand at Near Partner\n\nFar from making the department less human, the introduction of RPA has actually liberated it to become much more people-focused than before. This is because the automation of key business processes has allowed the staff previously overburdened with manual inputting duties to switch to providing a truly human-centric service.\n\nImplementing human-centred process automation\n\nImplementing human-centric process automation in an organisation comes down to finding the sweet spot between\n\nhuman-unique capabilities and highly automated systems\n\n–like a marriage between man and machine, so to say.\n\nThese are the most important steps to a human-cantered approach.\n\nDefine the goal\n\nof the process and an objective measure of success.\n\nIdentify human work\n\n. Start by identifying the tasks that need to be done by people, then the tasks than can be automated but aren’t yet, and the tasks outside the process that are still fundamental to its completion.\n\nDetermine conclusions\n\n, the choices or options that will lead to the next process or conclude the present.\n\nDefine a task order\n\n. As tasks are subject to conditions, it is necessary for you to define them and create an order.\n\nAttribute roles\n\nby determining who will be responsible by performing what.\n\nSelect information\n\n. Depending on what the process is, different types and amounts of information will be needed in order to move on to the next stage.\n\nDetermine who has access to information\n\n, especially with sensitive data–i.e., personal customer data, financial data, etc.\n\nSet deadlines\n\nand what happens within the time limit and outside of it. Should it issue a warning? Should it escalate the matter to other people or management?\n\nDisplay the information\n\nin a way that human operators can understand and take the next steps, like decision-making, evaluation, or authorisation.\n\nIntegrate the data\n\n. The information needs to be collected from various sources (how?) and sent to various destinations (where?).\n\nBuild a proof of concept\n\n. Test-drive your thoughts with a first\n\nproof of concept\n\n, a way of assessing the viability of a certain product for a specific business need.\n\nWhile automating processes isn’t necessarily complicated, making process automation human-centric requires a bit more thought and planning. However, the result is a streamlined human-system cooperation and communication.\n\nProcess automation at Near Partner\n\nNeed help to find a business process automation tool that puts the user in the centre? Maybe building it from scratch? Or are you struggling with the technical aspect of implementation?\n\nGet in touch\n\n!\n\nAt Near Partner, we’ve made it our mission to facilitate the communication between humans and technology and, so far, we’re proud to say\n\nwe’ve met our customers’ demands and helped them and their business in their path to success\n\n.

    "content": "When one of us achieves a personal and professional goal, the whole team celebrates. This time is Nelson’s turn to shine: meet our OutSystems Champion!\n\nWe are here, once again, to boast about our people. This time is\n\nNelson André\n\n, who has gone above and beyond for Near Partner and OutSystems. Let us introduce him.\n\nMeet Nelson\n\nDo you know one of those persons that make it fun to login to work on the gloomiest Mondays? Meet Nelson, a developer here at Near Partner, a dear colleague, and a friend.\n\nHe is also an OutSystems Champion\n\n. Although this is absolutely no surprise to us, we couldn’t help but be incredibly proud of his achievements and excited for him and his journey. Outsystems, by the way, is a\n\nlowcode platform\n\nthat speeds up development of enterprise grade apps. It is also the fastest way to get your new project off the ground.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the\n\nOutSystems Champions Program\n\n, let us break it down for you. The Champions Program essentially\n\nidentifies, recognises, and rewards community leaders\n\n, such as Nelson. The program provides a framework for collaboration between community enthusiasts and OutSystems teams. Champions are there to guide and help the whole OutSystems community.\n\nBut now, back to Nelson.\n\nBeing an OutSystems Champion is, for Nelson, a recognition of the availability he has always shown to all his colleagues, partners, and clients, but also to the contributions in\n\nmentoring and coaching to the OutSystems community\n\n. And, yes, Nelson is an avid OutSystems enthusiast and a bit of an advocate as well.\n\nFor Nelson, becoming a Champion is, in his own words, “\n\none more step\n\n” in his “\n\nrelationship and personal investment with the OutSystems community and technology\n\n”. It represents one more step in his career path,\n\ntowards becoming an OutSystems MVP\n\n. One day soon, he might join the ranks of\n\nMarcelo Ferreira\n\n, a fellow colleague here at Near Partner who reached that rarefied MVP-air only a few experience.\n\nBut for the time being, Nelson is busy celebrating:\n\nNelson “coaching” his teammates on survival skills with a Nerf Gun fight.\n\n“More than implementing projects, we aim to be true partners to our clients.”\n\nNelson has been with Near Partner since 2018 and, during that time, he has both improved as a developer and\n\ncontributed to a fantastic workplace\n\n. We can say that, like with the OutSystems community, Nelson has learned quite a lot, and he has also\n\ngiven back a lot\n\n.\n\nWhen questioned about his work at Near Partner, Nelson says that “\n\nmore than implementing projects, we aim to be true partners to our clients, to understand their realities and struggles, and to really put ourselves in their shoes\n\n.” In the end, the goal is to help clients succeed in whatever their endeavours are.\n\n“\n\nNear Partner has a certified, diversified team, with many years of experience in projects across several business areas, geographies and technologies\n\n,” Nelson adds, “\n\nand we’ve shown that we can tackle any challenge we face.\n\n”\n\nFor Nelson, the pillars of his and his team’s work, as well as the pillars of the working philosophy at Near Partner are “\n\nthe pillars of the Agile methodology: Transparency, Inspection and Adaptation\n\n”. These core values, although being a part of a project management methodology, are used every day at Near Partner “\n\namong teammates, between teams, but also in our relations with clients\n\n”.\n\nHow is the selection process at the Champions Program?\n\nCurious about the OutSystems Champions Program? Luckily, Nelson is willing to give us a sneak peek into the Champions’ world:\n\n“First, to become a Champion you need to have vast experience in OutSystems and contribute to different areas of the community. Then you should choose an area of focus where you must share knowledge and experience. In my case, is Mentoring Community members to become more mature OutSystems developers, which is something I love to do!”\n\nAccording to OutSystems, the focus areas are intended to help Champions stand out in their specific contributions, but also allow OutSystems to support them in the best possible way.\n\n“The eligibility criteria will depend on which area of contribution you will be focused on. But range from contributing in Forums, creating components in Forge, organizing events, speaking at events, write technical content and mentoring people across organizations.\n\nOnce you meet all the requirements, you will be invited to an interview with an OutSystems’ Community Manager. The interview is focused on your interests, motivations, and expectations, as well as to determine why and if you should be selected.”\n\nAfter the interview, the OutSystems community team will analyse your application and decide whether you will be invited to join the program or not.\n\n“If you are an experienced developer and participative in the community, it is highly likely that you already meet many of these criteria. So, what you waiting for? Take a chance!”\n\n“In my experience, this achievement is another step to grow both personally and professionally within this incredible community that is OutSystems!”\n\nWorking at Near Partner\n\nIs Near Partner suited for a Champion? We\n\nwere\n\nconsidered one of the\n\nhappiest companies\n\nand we are proud to know that it shows.\n\n“\n\nNear Partner is a people-centred company. More than having the best professionals–which we absolutely do–we also want to have the best people, and that they are happy here, and can take this to their projects with clients. When you hear that a company is strongly committed to everyone’s personal and professional development, you normally dismiss it as corporate propaganda. But here at Near Partner it is not just talk, it actually means something.”\n\nThis is what a fantastic team of talented and brilliant people looks like. If you’d like to know what it feels like to work with an expert team in laid-back environment, reach out.\n\nWe have a spot for you.",

    "content": "Increasing user take-up among colleagues is no easy feat. This is how companies around the world create a flawless business app onboarding process.\n\nIn HR, employee onboarding refers to introducing a new hire to all aspects of an organisation. Employee onboarding covers every area of the company, from its culture to the tools and information needed for the employee to become a productive member of the team.\n\nWell, app onboarding, used in IT, is the\n\nin-app process that guides new users\n\n, that helps them get acquainted with the app’s features, and that conveys its value. After a good app onboarding, user experience is likely to improve.\n\nBusiness app onboarding, specifically, is directed at users who will use enterprise solutions such as CRMs, ERPs, BIs, project management tools, and so on.\n\nMAIN OBSTACLES TO BUSINESS APP USAGE (2020)\n\nDespite the best intentions on the part of businesses to deploy new apps,\n\n38% of users in businesses\n\ncontext are not using the deployed capabilities. The top barriers to usage include the IT staff being unable to support the deployment and the lack of end-user training/awareness.\n\nBecause of the complexity of these enterprise-grade apps, onboarding can often be tedious or even lacking in some regards,\n\nleaving the user’s IT team to deal with inevitable pitfalls\n\n.\n\nWhy enterprise-grade app onboarding is important\n\nWhile\n\ndesigning an enterprise-grade app\n\n, our developers here at Near Partner likes to through a few (often annoying, granted) questions around: What are the\n\neasiest and the most difficult features to use\n\n? What compels users to this app? Why do we need this button, feature, screen or text? The answers to these questions form the basis of a grand app onboarding experience. But why does a business app need an onboarding process in the first place?\n\nIt drives adoption\n\nMany companies struggle with new apps or software because its users resist using it. And while the word “resistance” is misleading, as it places the blame solely on the users, it is often a symptom of a\n\npoor customer experience\n\nor a sloppy onboarding process. Documentation is great for the IT department, but not so much for the people who will actually use the app. But an efficient app onboarding process might work where docs fail .\n\nIt avoids “shelfware”\n\nUsers ten to abandon apps perceived as “difficult” to work with. Apps that complicate work rather than simplify end up as “shelfware”, passed over by others perceived as more intuitive. One keyway to counter this fate is to create an excellent onboarding process so that, even if the app is not entirely intuitive,\n\nthe app onboarding guides users past the main pain points\n\n.\n\nIt boosts performance\n\nBusinesses implement new solutions when the previous one was not getting the job done. If users have the know-how to take advantage of all the features of the app, then their performance, as well as the app’s, will see an improvement. To do so, it is important to pick the\n\nright app development software\n\n, one that allows for quick changes, tests and scalability.\n\nHow to do app onboarding the right way\n\nTo create an effective app onboarding process, you’ll need to plan.\n\nCreate app ambassadors\n\nInside organisations, that is. This means offering the place of ambassador to those who will become the go-to people for the rest of the organisation, for that specific solution. Obviously, this will involve training and learning. Ambassadors are often out-spoken members of the Leadership Team,\n\nwho are expected to embrace innovation and promote change\n\nin their teams.\n\nTraining\n\nAmbassadors are not the only ones in need of training. Maybe the solution requires a bit more technical knowledge, or maybe it has features that require certain skills to be put to practice. This is where training comes in at an organisational level. Such training is also a way to promote a\n\ncompany culture that embraces change.\n\nChange the culture\n\nA company’s culture is part of its identity. But even the strongest identities sometimes need an uplift. A culture that can’t keep up with the changes inside the organisation needs to, well, change. Maybe it’s time to rethink what drives you, your team and your business. See\n\nwhat drives us at Near Partner\n\n.\n\nUser Acceptance Testing (UAT)\n\nUAT is, basically, verifying that a solution works for the intended user. It is the last phase of the software testing process, and a\n\ncritical part of software development\n\nand should occur just before market rollout. In it, users test the software to make sure it can handle the required\n\ntasks in real-world scenarios.\n\nHypercare\n\nHypercare refers to the level of support our customers get on that period just after a launch, to ensure the seamless adoption of the new system. This period is usually of two weeks, and the concept is essentially: “Ask Me Anything, Anytime”. Hypercare is critical in business-grade app onboarding.\n\nUncomplicated app onboarding with the right partner\n\nCall us\n\nand let’s chat and see what\n\nour incredible team\n\ncan do for you and your business. We provide\n\nSalesforce\n\nand\n\nOutsystems\n\nservices, as well as\n\nSoftware development services\n\n. Do you know our very own Outsystems Champion?\n\nStill unsure about outsourcing?

    "content": "The time to build an app has come. What’s the best approach?\n\nGet your answers to the question of low-code vs traditional development.\n\nThere are essentially two ways to go building software or apps. But what’s the kicker? Both approaches have pros and cons, depending on what you want and your business needs. You might think app development is app development, right? You’re absolutely right, but do you know which kind is right for you? That’s what the question of low-code vs traditional development is all about.\n\nLow-code\n\nWith Low-code developers can build applications via a drag-and-drop visual interface. The modules are pre-maid and, by default, communicate with each other.\n\nSource:\n\nOutSystems\n\nDoes that mean that low-code requires no coding at all? Not really. On a first glance, yes, you can build your whole app without needing to do so much in terms of manual programming. However, there might be some tweaking or fine-tuning required, and this will require some coding.\n\nTraditional Development\n\nTraditional development (also called custom software development) is 100% coding, from start to finish. Building software this way requires an experience programming team. You’ll obviously need to know at the very least one programming language, but most likely a few. Traditional development is also a team job, where several developers put your vision into many, many lines of code. Remember, this is a “from scratch” process.\n\nLow-code vs Traditional Development\n\nCIO’s often wonder about the practical aspects of low-code vs traditional development.\n\nThese are the fundamental questions that need answering.\n\n1. Which has the shortest time-to-market?\n\nOne of the top pros of low-code is that it is fast. And we mean,\n\nfast\n\n. Comparing low-code vs traditional development in terms of time to market is something like days or weeks vs. months. Read more on how\n\nenterprise-grade low-code can speed up time-to-market\n\n.\n\n2. Which has the most compatibility options?\n\nLow-code\n\nplatforms\n\nare inherently multi-device compatible. The apps created in low-code platforms can then run on all core platforms, such as web, mobile and cloud, and on all devices. Traditional development requires the app to be developed separately for each platform.\n\n3. Which generates the least tech debt?\n\nTechnical debt\n\nis basically the time and money a company needs to apply to software upgrades, releases of newer versions of programming languages, company expansions, outdated legacy systems, or even low-quality code, bugs, and errors.\n\nLow-code is less prone to generate technical debt, since the modules are pre-coded and designed to fit in with each other. Custom dev, however, can generate more tech debt since all the maintenance is up to the actual developers.\n\n4. Which is more scalable?\n\nScalability is the ability of an app to handle a growing number of customers, clients, or users. It guarantees that, over time, the app can sustain the growth of its user base. Low-code and cloud-native app development make scalability much easier. Of course, a traditionally developed app, be it web or mobile, can also be scaled, but this is a much more complex process.\n\n5. Which requires more investment?\n\nThere is some investment to be made with both methods, and it also depends on what you look for. To build low-code-based apps you’ll need a low-code platform for the graphic interface, where you then can build apps in a drag-and-drop fashion. This platform usually comes with a fee. While traditional development does not require such a platform, it does usually take longer, making such projects more expensive from the getgo. Also, since custom development is more error-prone, delays and hidden costs are frequent.\n\n6. Which is the most intuitive option?\n\nFor a developer, both low-code and traditional development are intuitive in their own way. However, traditional development does not allow citizen development, whereas low-code does. In principle, creating an app from scratch with low-code does not require previous knowledge of programming or coding. But it is necessary further along the way to customise the app. With traditional dev, you’ll need these skills from the beginning.\n\nLow-code vs Traditional Development\n\n: the takeaways\n\nSo, to wrap up the question of low-code vs traditional development, we summed the differences between them.\n\nWhile\n\nlow-code development\n\nallows citizen development and speeds up time-to-market in up to 10x, it requires a platform. It is generally cloud-based, meaning this platform is maintained externally, and that includes all upgrades, security patches, etc, that your team does not need to worry about. Customization in low-code requires actual coding by actual developers. Since companies build low-code apps through a platform, there is, most of the time, vendor lock-in.\n\nTraditional custom development\n\nis a job for software developers only and requires specific hard skills that a citizen developer does not have. That being said, custom dev takes time, and depending on what you and your business need, a lot of time. As a big pro, you have total control over your software, but also responsibility over updates, enhancement, and growth (because, how they say,\n\nwith great power\n\n…). This means you can customize software and have complete ownership and rights to it.\n\nLowcode vs. Traditional Development: which is best?\n\nSource.\n\nTech Target\n\nBut wait, are you still unsure? If the whole low-code vs traditional development thing is still running through your thoughts and you’re uncertain about which to choose for your app, for your company and for your budget,\n\ngive us a shout\n\n!\n\nDoes your project need a partner?\n\nDo you want a low-code-based app you can build yourself, but need some customization? We can help with that! Or, on the contrary, do you want your own app, built from scratch, completely fine-tuned to your liking? We can help with that too!\n\nAt Near Partner, we are a team of experienced developers, fluent in both\n\ncustom software development\n\nand\n\nlow-code development\n\n, who have extensive experience in helping our customers decide which is the best development approach for their projects, taking budgets, company structure, teams, and\n\nproof of concept\n\ninto account.

    "content": "Speed, convenience, cost – what makes a great digital experience? Once a mere buzzword, the question is no longer ‘if’ but ‘how’, and the goal is to stand out from the bunch.\n\nThe world is going digital, and\n\nthe speed got supersonic since COVID\n\n. From school lessons and office work to\n\nphysical exercise\n\nand doctors’ appointments – more aspects of people’s daily social and professional lives are moving digital.  Because of that, providing an excellent digital experience is a top priority for any savvy manager.\n\nSee how\n\nAgile helped us survive (and thrive) all the way through COVID\n\n.\n\nWhat is a Digital Experience?\n\nDigital experience is the\n\ncomplete set of interactions between a customer and an organisation\n\n, made possible via digital technologies. It includes all contact the first time a customer visits an e-commerce all the way through to that much-desired checkout button. These interactions, all part of the consumer journey, determine the satisfaction of your customer and are a major part of why they become loyal to a business.\n\nA\n\nplanned, customized and omnichannel\n\ndigital strategy is essential to stand out from the bunch—especially for e-commerce. But, although digital technologies are the vehicle, a digital experience strategy is as much about IT as it is about your customers’ needs.\n\nWhat are the benefits for businesses?\n\nThese are the major advantages of a customer-driven digital experience:\n\nCustomers will remember you\n\nA digital experience is all about how your business presents itself to customers and clients. A pleasant image, a powerful presence, and a reliable voice are a\n\nproven path to resonate with customers\n\n. The more you affect them, the more difficult your brand is to forget.\n\nConversions get easier.\n\nThere are many conversion best-practices popping up every day. Still, the one everyone seems to agree on? Word-of-mouth. Yes, that same technique that has been shaping humanity for thousands of years is still a powerful driving force. A great d\n\nigital experience is the first step towards achieving that.\n\nHere’s\n\nour guide to growth hacking\n\n, that lists some of the ways we’ve helped companies grow.\n\nBuild a loyal customer base\n\nIn 2018,\n\n50% of customers said that their experience\n\nwas influential in their decision to purchase (or not purchase) a product or service. In fact, companies that value customer service see additional revenue growth of 4% to 8%. T\n\nIf a digital experience is so good that your customers not only remember you but also talk about you, then they will certainly come back. Again and again.\n\nEvidently, to reap the benefits of a great digital experience, you also need to sow the seeds.\n\nHow to achieve an excellent customer-driven digital experience?\n\nTo achieve an excellent digital experience, your teams need to collaborate as a whole.\n\nFocus on inclusivity\n\nWith the world going digital, your business can virtually reach any corner of the world, so the digital experience needs to be inclusive.\n\nHaving a diverse team\n\n(or teams) working on your digital experience strategy will amplify its outreach. With customers from all over the world, at Near Partner, we understand the importance of a diverse, multi-background team. This is one reason our recruitment process values people with a unique background and skill set.\n\nKeep a 360º view\n\nTo create a great digital experience, you need to know your customers. And to know your customers, you need to understand their behavior –\n\nwhy they do what they do\n\n, at scale. Powerful tools like\n\nSalesforce Customer 360\n\ncan provide your business with a holistic view of your customers, which is an absolute necessity for creating a customer-centric experience.\n\nStay consistent across channels\n\nA great digital experience is omnichannel-consistent. The channels of interaction can’t be siloed. Instead, information\n\nshould flow seamlessly between devices\n\n, from the first touch point to the very last one.\n\nStay on top of the latest digital trends\n\nInnovation should happen\n\nat the speed of technological change\n\n. And this obviously means taking some risks instead of playing it safe by sticking with tried-and-true strategies. Many of the disruptive technologies that were once reserved for big players, like AI and VR, are now within everyone’s reach. Isn’t the future brilliant? We’ve recently published some of the latest\n\napp development trends for 2021 and beyond\n\n, which can help companies navigate these challenging times.\n\nAny excellent strategy starts with choosing the right partners\n\nAt Near Partner we work with organizations all over the world to create and streamline unique digital experiences.

    "content": "Workflow automation makes processes simpler, but it can be a tricky task. Can low-code turn the entire process of automation simple and intuitive? We think it can.\n\nAutomation is an imperative in the business world. The way we do business has gotten faster, smoother, more intuitive, and with less room for mistakes. Even before Covid-19,\n\norganizations all over the world were investing a lot of time and money\n\nreplacing manual, error-prone processes and workflows with more reliable digital alternatives.\n\nBut the very nature of workflow automation is ever changing because, just like the world, processes evolve, and user and customer expectations are not stagnant. So how can you make the best of workflow automation?\n\nBut first, let’s get the basics straight:\n\nWhat is workflow automation?\n\nSimple process automation allows you to, well, automate individual processes.\n\nWorkflow automation, however, refers to a chain of individual processes that together create a workflow\n\n.\n\nWith workflow automation in place, it is possible to generate business documents, assign tasks to different departments and to different people, send, store, and share data and files across multiple systems.\n\nWhat does the sales approval process look like with workflow automation?\n\nSource:\n\nDigital Fields\n\nBots route tasks, data, or files between systems and people according to a set of rules. This simplifies tasks, accelerates processes and eliminates unnecessary, often manual, work.\n\nHow can workflow automation help your business?\n\nThe first, most obvious benefit of this type of automation is a serious cut down on time spent on menial tasks in a loop. This frees up up time to focus on more meaningful, value-added tasks. However, there are more benefits.\n\nStreamline the processes at the core of your business\n\nWorkflow automation enables collaboration on an entirely new level. Work moves effortlessly from person-to-person, system-to-system, to the cloud and back–without bottlenecks or breakdowns. Transform manual tasks into sophisticated digital processes that move your business forward.\n\nFewer repetitive tasks\n\nEliminate red-tape, accelerate digital transformation, and maximize productivity by automating almost any business process.\n\nAutomated document management\n\nQuickly and easily create consistent, compliant, up-to-date digital documents. Automatically send files for redlining, approval, e-signature, and storage.\n\nReal-time process analytics\n\nEstablish a culture of continuous process improvement by monitoring workflow performance and discovering data-driven, actionable insights.\n\nWhat departments are more likely to benefit from workflow automation?\n\nVirtually all departments, from finance to marketing, live with the burden of repetitive manual processes that are strong candidates for improvement via workflow automation. For example:\n\nHuman resources\n\n: reduce paperwork by streamlining sourcing, verification, and recruitment with automated approval.\n\nSales\n\n: automate pricing and generate reports on ongoing sales.\n\nIT\n\n: manage support requests, avoid duplicates, assign tickets to team members.\n\nFinance dept\n\n.: schedule automatic payments for recurring invoices, create a smart payroll management system or integrate data between various accounting software.\n\nMarketing\n\n: create a consistent lead nurturing process or schedule and manage multiple campaigns simultaneously.\n\nAs a concrete example, let’s look at a basic workflow, a daily occurrence for a small business like an ecommerce. Every time a customer places an order, a series of events need to happen in succession before the order can be shipped and the customer receives it. This is the workflow in question.\n\nAfter the customer places the order, it enters the seller’s system and a confirmation e-mail lets the customer know the order is being processed. The finance department verifies the payment and emits an invoice in a second confirmation email. After that, the system confirms the availability at the warehouse and the product is ready for picking, packaging and shipping. The system then creates and prints carrier and delivery forms. Later, logistics organizes a carrier pick up.\n\nIf something doesn’t check out (say, if order quantities and shipped quantities don’t match) the system flags and alerts someone in the organizations.\n\nThis form of workflow automation saves time\n\n, cuts down errors, and streamlines the day-to-day of your teams.\n\nAutomating your workflows with low-code\n\nTo implement a workflow automation process, you’ll need to start off with a clear aim and go through five stages of evaluation:\n\n1. Identify a repetitive chain of processes\n\nWhat tasks could benefit from automation? What individual processes are more time and resource consuming in that chain, and how can automation improve them?\n\n2. Define specific goals for the automated tasks\n\nWhich benefits of workflow automation and automation are you trying to achieve? Think about increased ROI, increased team productivity, faster time-to-market, cost cut-down, etc.\n\n3. Invest in proper training\n\nTo reap the benefits, you’ll need to get your teams on board. Explain and communicate what is going to happen, what the expectations are, and what each role is in the workflow.\n\n4. Design the workflow\n\nAfter defining the workflow, you’ll need to design it, and low-code is the star here. With a simple interface, you can design the flow, define priorities, assign permissions, and create rules for each step.\n\n5. Measure KPIs and ROI\n\nWhile this step is not essential in the action of creating workflow automation, it is especially important to compare how the workflow automation has improved pre-existing processes. Good news is,\n\nlow-code allows you to measure KPIs and ROI\n\n, for example, easily, through reports and data analytics.\n\nBut… Why low code?\n\nThere are several benefits of implementing workflow automation with low-code. These are more important:\n\nSimplicity\n\n: the point of workflow automation is to make processes simpler. So it makes sense that the design tool is equally easy and intuitive to use, like a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface.\n\nCloud-based\n\n: workflow automation tools on the cloud are much less of a hassle to maintain and run than on-site tools, because of their accessibility, security, and ability to scale.\n\nIntegration\n\n: a workflow automation software should allow for seamless cross-system integration.\n\nCustomization\n\n: since each business is unique, so are the processes behind it. When using a workflow automation software, make sure that it allows for full customization to your business.\n\nReports and analytics: workflow automation software tools must offer in-built reporting to allow you to monitor, analyze and quantify improvements, setbacks, lags, or even opportunities. AI, anyone?\n\nPartners in automation\n\nDo you need help or guidance while choosing, implementing, or customizing a workflow automation tool or software? You’ve come to the right place.

    "content": "Is robotic process automation the start of the long-awaited robot revolution that will dominate the business world? This is how RPA is helping streamline repetitive tasks.\n\nWith the business world moving at such a fast pace, CIOs are looking for better and smarter ways to simplify business processes and cut costs in their organizations. Robotic process automation makes it possible to unburden people from tedious and repetitive tasks, freeing them to perform high-value tasks. This is what RPA means and how to implement it.\n\nWhat is robotic process automation?\n\nRobotic process automation, or RPA, is a business process automation technology. With it, programmers can set rules that enable the software (or “robot”) to automate tasks or processes. A RPA bot can then analyze, interpret, collect, and manipulate data before triggering pre-established responses.\n\nBusinesses use RPA in a wide variety of scenarios. From an automated reply to an email to sorting through thousands of job applications in the HR department. However, robotic process automation does not involve actual robots–much to our chagrin.\n\nWhy should you invest in RPA?\n\nRobotic process automation tools do not replace business applications, but automate menial manual tasks performed by humans. These tools can fill in, alter, and update the same boxes and fields in a user interface by getting the relevant data from a specific location, among many other tasks. Thus, RPA has several benefits for an organisation:\n\nHigher accuracy:\n\nrobotic process automation removes human error from the equation. This ensures 100% compliance, which is essential in many industries like finances, healthcare and life sciences.\n\nGreater productivity:\n\nwith RPA, “robots” perform essential but time-consuming and, frankly, monotonous tasks. They get work done faster and free human workers for tasks that require creativity and decision making.\n\nGreater resilience\n\n: the extra pair of hands provided by robotic process automation can handle huge workload peaks and respond to demand spikes without a hiccup, and at a speed that no human can match.\n\nAccelerated transformation:\n\norganizations can improve RPA with machine learning, speech recognition, natural language processing, and other cognitive technologies in order to automate tasks that require perceptual and judgment capabilities. This is a driver of\n\ndigital transformation\n\n.\n\nApart from that, robotic process automation can help you deliver much better customer service and an\n\nexcellent digital experience\n\nfor your customers.\n\nWhich industries are using RPA?\n\nRobotic process automation is transversal to pretty much all industries: insurance, banking, healthcare, manufacturing, public sector, life sciences, and so on. It can improve customer service, for example, with intelligent chatbots; process invoices faster and without errors, to streamline payroll; ensure data protection by handling sensitive information remotely; perform analytics and reports and so much more. Deloitte surveys suggest that RPA will achieve “near-universal adoption” in the next 5 years.\n\nTake global financial insights provider\n\nMorningstar\n\nfor instance: after decades of manually creating investment recommendations, this leading firm is now relying on RPA to get the job done.\n\nBut the true beauty of RPA is that the list of applications keeps growing, since AI and machine learning are so deeply intertwined with it. (And if you are one of the sceptical ones, check\n\nif your business really needs AI and Machine Learning\n\n.)\n\nHow to implement a robotic process automation software?\n\nTo implement robotic process automation within your organisation, you first need to identify processes that are a match. The processes and tasks to automate with RPA are:\n\nRule-based, i.e., repetitive and with few exceptions.\n\nExpected to have logical outcomes.\n\nRepeated at regular intervals or have defined triggers.\n\nComposed of high volume of data, tasks, etc.\n\nAfter identifying your candidate processes, you’ll need to design the RPA workflow for each one, followed by development (either by coding or using a low-code software), testing, and finally deploying your software. Do you know the\n\ndifference between traditional and low-code development\n\n?\n\nA little help from an RPA expert can never hurt\n\nRobotic process automation, like all innovative technologies, has some known pitfalls you should absolutely avoid at the organizational, technical and process levels.\n\nAt an organizational level, the most common pitfalls are lack of\n\ntime commitment\n\nfrom local team, insufficient\n\nIT support\n\nand the absence of a clear RPA\n\nstrategy\n\n. Technically, it is common for companies to choose solutions that require\n\nextensive coding\n\n, to forget\n\nscalability\n\nand to not take\n\nmaintenance\n\nneeds into account.\n\nFinally, at a process level, the most common pitfalls are choosing the wrong processes, because they’re not\n\nrules-based\n\n, or they don’t have\n\nsignificant business impact\n\n, or because they are too\n\ncomplex\n\n.\n\nTo stay away from these common mistakes, look for a partner to guide you in the right direction. Luckily, at Near Partner we are\n\nproblem solvers\n\nand RPA experts, and we’re keen to help you with your robotic process automation journey.\n\nIf you’re looking to embark on the RPA ship and could use a compass,\n\nget in touch\n\n!

    "content": "We built Near Partner on the premise that something special would come out of putting together bright people and fascinating challenges. And after 4 thrilling years here we stand, eager for more. Thank you for being part of our journey.\n\nA virtuous cycle has been spinning round and round for the past 4 years. It’s a combination of demanding customers, exciting projects, gruelling coding and… take-no-prisoners Ping pong tournaments, ferociously caffeinated drinks and free-for-all Fortnite marathons. We’re turning 4 and as we reach this exciting landmark, we can’t help but look back in wonder. How did we get here?\n\n“That was easy.”\n\nWhen we started this journey, we reached the end of our first year with a team of seven – and truth be told, a great team of seven.\n\nWell, we worked hard that whole year. We felt motivated, comfortable in our roles and positions, thriving. Each member of this initial team approached everyday challenges as a problem solver, instead of a task-doer. The goal at the beginning of the year was to simplify everything as much as possible, in order to give the team more autonomy. And in response, this team of good, smart people would bring in significant results to a very young Near Partner. When we achieved that goal, we felt proud. Just as we cheered, friends, family, and partners, who cared for us, helped us stay grounded. It was a simple yet prescient warning. The hard part was to keep this same level when we doubled our size.\n\n“Next year won’t be as smooth.”\n\nThe following year Near Partner had nearly doubled. We were thirteen, and we still had that same spirit we started off with. In fact, this strong feeling of being a strong, united team was even heightened at the end of our second year as Near Partner. We kept doing what we were doing well and improved whatever we weren’t doing so well. Well, just as the previous year, we were told doing\n\nthat\n\nwas easy, but as soon as we got over the 20-mark, things would get complicated.\n\nAnother end-of-the-year came, and our numbers doubled. What about the team spirit? As good as new! Those same voices came back to keep us on a straight path.\n\nYou’ve had it easy so far. The hard part is yet to come.\n\n“The hard part starts now.”\n\nWell, right now we are a team of 30. Remember the initial seven? Yep, we’re all still here. And all of our spirit and competitive advantage are still going strong. But we still hear the same.\n\nIt’s going to get difficult from now on.\n\nDoes this mean we have ignored all the warnings and advice? Not at all; quite the contrary. We didn’t just hear, we listened, believed, and worked hard; we could overcome our challenges and keep track of our goals.\n\nSince the very beginning, our motto hasn’t changed. It doesn’t matter how much we grow; what matters is how well we grow. We want to grow as a team with the same vitality, comfort and joy that have allowed us to get where we are today.\n\nAnd so, we hope that a year from now, or two, or three, we can look back and say the same:\n\nit was hard work, it was tough, but we persevered, and we made it!\n\nSo, what’s next for this incredible team we call Near Partner?\n\nOur guess is we need to keep simplifying. And to simplify is very hard work…",

    "content": "5G promises to reshape businesses and customers alike. But does 5G mean for developers, today?\n\n5G is everywhere. From social media to IT departments, everyone is talking about it. But with so many misconceptions and, frankly, misinformation, it is hard to envision what 5G will bring to the table. Basically, the question is what does 5G mean?\n\nIs it faster? Enough to make a difference? Is it more reliable? In what way? Does it open up more doors? Where to? All these are valid concerns and may prevent you from embracing what is basically the future.\n\nFinally, you might struggle to understand what 5G means for software development. So, since we’re ecstatic with 5G, let us walk you through the basics first.\n\nWhat is 5G?\n\n5G is not a 4G 2.0. Period. It is in fact an entirely new network infrastructure, the fifth generation of mobile and broadband.\n\nTo put it simply, 5G uses three kinds of radio-wave frequencies: low, medium, and high. 1G, 2G and 3G mobile communication depends on these low radio frequencies as they are great for covering extensive areas. So does TV broadcasting. 4G networks and Wi-Fi run on medium radio frequencies which add more capacity. Satellite communication and car sensors require the granularity only high radio frequencies can provide.\n\n5G will use all three of them in a smarter way that allows for more capacity–say goodbye to congested networks–more speed, and for much quicker reaction times. 5G will expand connectivity to more than just phones. It really will\n\nconnect\n\nthe world\n\n. This changes everything.\n\nWhat does 5G mean for the future?\n\n5G networks started being deployed worldwide in 2019 (South Korea was the first nation to make it available), as you might have noticed, but it isn’t quite available everywhere… yet. This is because 5G requires different equipment than the ones we currently rely on.\n\nSounds like a big fuss for a\n\nslightly better internet connection\n\n? Oh, you’re in for a surprise.\n\n5G can deliver speeds up to 100 times faster than 4G\n\n, with ultra-low latency, up to 400 times lower. And with wider capacity, as much as 1 million devices can connect per square kilometre, versus 4G’s 2.000. It is much more than\n\nsimply better internet connection\n\n.\n\nImagine smart cars “talking” to each other, drones as emergency services, health monitoring devices transmitting information to healthcare providers almost instantly, interactive climate control systems, smart factories, 3D holographic advertisements. Imagine smart, sustainable cities. Sounds like a sci-fi movie, except it might as well be the reality.\n\n5G means more opportunities for companies\n\nWhile the benefits of a faster, wider, and lower-latency connection are pretty obvious – improved communications, more efficient remote work, precise automation, and so on – there are some other advantages brought in by 5G that are the real game-changers.\n\n5G opens the doors wide (and we mean, wide) for IoT. It also paves the way for improved AR, VR, or 3D applications, increased security, and did someone say Industry 4.0?\n\nIn sum, 5G opens up a world of opportunities for businesses, both in the backstage and for their customers. Expect everything from better-than-ever customer experience to smart management. Disruptive? Quite so.\n\nWhat does 5G mean for software development?\n\n5G has an enormous potential, which translates to an array of changes – good ones – for customers and businesses. But the actual stars behind the rise of 5G are, well, us, the developers. This is what 5G means for developers.\n\nReal multi-device software development\n\nSince 5G is designed for all devices, IoT will be one of the biggest winners of the 5G revolution. All kinds of devices will need a multitude of digital applications, just like smartphones do now.\n\nNew generation of mobile apps\n\nFrom healthcare to entertainment, 5G will transform virtually all sectors. Think immersive atmospheres delivered by AR, VR, MR, increased GPS performance, enhanced cloud compatibility, 4K, 360º and 3D video streaming… Can you even imagine tactile internet?\n\nA myriad of new app functionalities\n\nAnd apart from new apps, this new generation of mobile network can and will significantly improve the performance of many existing apps. How? By offering more speed, reliability, capacity and quicker response times, app developers will answer by creating app functionalities to suit these additional features.\n\nSecurity and privacy taken to a whole new level\n\nNetwork Slicing is another star feature of 5G. What this means is that 5G allows for different network “slices” inside one network, with no special-purpose networks. Any service can get a slice of the network without compromising speed, latency, capacity or reliability–especially interesting with healthcare, for instance.\n\nDoes this mean that transitioning to\n\n5G is easy\n\n? As with everything new, there are always challenges, and 5G is no exception. One particular (and reasonable) concern associated with 5G is security. With more and more data gathering, comes more possibilities for data breaches, for example. Another challenge is to re-imagine and re-design current software and apps to benefit from the new stability brought by 5G.\n\nFor us at Near Partner, this is an opportunity to come up with smarter, stronger and more permanent solutions to already existing problems – or, as we put it, to grow as developers.\n\nAt Near Partner we are ready to explore the potential of 5G\n\nWe are more than ready, in fact, we are eager. Exploring software development beyond the current limitations, learning the real meaning of innovation, and really,\n\nreally diving into a digitally transformed world\n\nis just like developer heaven.\n\nDo you and your business need help though this journey?\n\nTalk to us.\n\nWe can help you explore your options and take connectivity and applications to the next level. We’re all in for this exciting ride.",

    "content": "debt may hinder your company’s chances of creating great software. This is what it means, what causes it and how to fight it off.\n\nTechnical debt lurks in almost every company, a result of hasty decisions, time-to-market pressure and simply the fact that developers are, well, humans. But when technical debt grows uncontrollably, it can affect a company’s ability to innovate, deliver great products and even keep teams motivated. This is what technical debt means,\n\nWhy it is so important and what you can do to prevent it.\n\nYou’ll learn:\n\nWhat is technical debt?\n\nWhy is Technical Debt so important?\n\nWhat are the several types of technical debt?\n\nWhat are the root causes of technical debt?\n\nHow to get rid of technical debt?\n\nPartnering up to stay away from technical debt\n\nWhat is technical debt?\n\nTechnical debt refers to the extra work that comes along with choosing an easy implementation over an efficient one. It is a quite common phenomenon in software development, when immediate and unconsidered code implementation decisions take place – easy to execute in the short term, but with a negative impact in the long run.\n\nSoftware development requires time, critical and analytical thinking to plan and organize solid code so that goals are achieved and sustained in the long term. However, companies are often tempted by the prospect of addressing customer requirements as quickly as possible, often implementing quick fixes, without considering the long-term implications and costs.\n\nThis can also occur due to low involvement in the project or lack of resources. Whatever the reason, this prioritization of speed and short-term results over quality often leads to deviations from the originally planned. Then, technical debt arises, triggering unplanned code changes which leads to a backlog that prevents the project from developing.\n\nHowever, there’s also technical debt which is created even with careful consideration and correct decisions along the way. There are changes due to technical shifts, to new business needs, legal needs, or other. These changes might require quick solutions that were not be aligned with what was expected or the existing code.\n\nSo, in a way, technical debt is a by-product of software development.\n\nIn some regards, technical debt is remarkably similar to a normal financial debt: they both require the payment of interest. With technical debt, interest takes the form of an extra effort to develop new future codes. It is possible to pay the debt all at once, rewriting the entire code, or pay it in instalments, creating code for every problem that arises as a direct consequence of the technical debt.\n\nWhy is Technical Debt so important?\n\nTechnical debts can generate a series of problems with important\n\nfinancial consequences\n\n. The time and money needed to fix software can add up to astronomical numbers.\n\nThe sum of several wrong decisions quickly turns into a large technical debt up to a point when it is no longer possible to avoid. In the end, the team will wind up doing twice the work. In extreme scenarios, every line of code may need to be redeveloped from scratch, making all the previous work useless.\n\nShortcuts and assumptions can help in the short term, but they end up disrupting systems, causing delays throughout the various versions of the project. This undermines the team’s motivation, which reduces the companies’ effectiveness.\n\nIn short, technical debt leads to late and incomplete deliveries, degradation of trust, inferior quality and waste of resources. For the team, it generates frustration, low productivity, constant friction and mistrust.\n\nWhat are the several types of technical debt?\n\nTechnical debt can be classified into 4 main groups.\n\nIrresponsible and purposeful technical debt\n\n.\n\nThe developer team doesn’t have time to create a complete and stable solution, and uses a fast alternative, disregarding quality. It is the same as simply saying: “We don’t have time.”\n\nPrudent and purposeful technical debt\n\n.\n\nThe team is under strong deadline pressure and chooses, consciously and informed, to deliver a faster and lower quality solution, proactively assuming the consequences. Put simply, it is the same as saying: “We have to deliver now and deal with the consequences.”\n\nIrresponsible and unintentional technical debt\n\n.\n\nThe team is unaware of the basic principles of good code, without foreseeing the consequences that fast and careless work can cause. This is what happens when someone goes “Tests? What tests?”\n\nPrudent and unintentional technical debt\n\n.\n\nThe team delivers a solution that, over development, seems to be the best one, but once it is completed, they detect vulnerabilities that could have been avoided. Something like saying: “Now we know how it should have been done.”\n\nIn each case, the output is very much the same. Technical debts lead to unreadable code, code duplication, tangle of dependencies, outdated documentation, unnecessary complexity, and a biased team.\n\nWhat are the root causes of technical debt?\n\nImagine a company that is launching an app. The dev team, already under pressure, encounters a complex problem and applies a quick fix to meet the deadline. Not a big deal, right? They can just revisit it later, before it causes any troubles. Well, this is they create exactly how tech debt.\n\nTechnical debt can be caused by much more than just sloppy developers or faulty code.\n\nSometimes, it might be unavoidable, because of software upgrades, releases of newer versions of programming languages, company expansions, budget limitations, outdated legacy systems, and more. Here are the 6 most common root causes of technical debt.\n\nPoor quality code\n\nInferior quality code is one of the most frequent causes of technical debt. Developers may want to try out the latest tools without fully mastering them or before the project is properly planned.\n\nPoor leadership\n\nThe operational team may not fully understand decisions that are taken by managers, creating technical debt, such as resorting to unnecessary or inappropriate tools or libraries.\n\nEmployee turnover\n\nAnother source of technical debt is employee turnover. Programmers who are new to a project often must carry on the work developed by their previous colleagues.\n\nNo sharing\n\nWhen a programmer does not share work-related information with the entire team, he is blocking collective collaboration and generating friction in the project flow, creating technical debts.\n\nNo testing\n\nWhen software is not tested, the result is rarely positive. Testing allows the team to identify and resolve code problems before the final implementation, at which point the resolution is less feasible.\n\nWhatever the cause, the impact can be tremendous on a team’s morale and productivity, as well as in the overall quality of the software. And no one is truly immune. Take Twitter, which initially built its front end through Ruby on Rails, then quickly replaced it with a Java server to improve search performance. Although the shift allowed the team to reduce the latency time in searches, it also accumulated significant technical debt, making it difficult to add resources and jeopardizing search reliability.\n\nInstagram was also a victim of technical debt. In 2010, they launched the iPhone app on a single server, and in just 6 hours, the backend was overloaded. To provide a high-speed response, they moved the database in just 3 days to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, but the consequences of this quick fix meant they eventually had to redo the code from scratch.\n\nHow to get rid of technical debt?\n\nDeveloping a plan for managing and avoiding technical debt is essential for fast, fluid, and high-quality teamwork. Here are some ways you can keep technical debts at bay.\n\nDefine a clear initial strategy\n\nBefore starting a project, anticipate and define all the technical details involved, as if it were a roadmap. Identify every requirement and specific feature and anticipate, quantify and expose potential risks and how to respond to them. By doing so, you will avoid redoing the work.\n\nImplement DevOps\n\nImplement\n\nDevOps practices\n\nto achieve shorter development cycles and more frequent deployments. When both development and operations teams are coordinated, the project is less error-prone and achieves a more effective response.\n\nGo agile\n\nSome might argue that Agile prioritises speed over quality–and to them we say: that’s because they don’t understand Agile like we do. A faster pace does not mean careless work, and Agile is not synonymous with “quick and dirty”. Instead, the Agile approach (in development and in mindset) is technical debt’s nemesis, with frequent iterations of work, tackling small chunks of work at a time, testing automation, modularization of architecture, and so on.\n\nRaise awareness of the importance of avoiding technical debt\n\nIf everyone is aware of the consequences of technical debt, including management and commercial teams, there will be greater collective involvement to avoid them. Quantify the undesirable effects to reinforce how much everyone benefits from keeping technical debts at bay.\n\nInvest time on a strong Architecture\n\nJust as important as a sterling code is a strong architecture that allows you to start with a lightweight design and grow over time, step by step, and to actively track and manage (unavoidable) technical debt. The choice of coding platform should consider how legacy systems will be integrated since this is one factor contributing to software entropy technical debt.\n\nResist quick fixes to save time\n\nQuick fixes are often not the best long-term solution, and as far as technical debt is concerned, this couldn’t be truer. In fact, delaying the launch of a product can make it a success, rather than releasing it on time with troublesome flaws.\n\nBad code equals technical debt, eventually. Having a skilled developing team who follows rigorous business processes is crucial to avoid code debt. Technical debt is also very common in companies that don’t have high-level technical management or a CTO.\n\nTest, test, test\n\nObviously, the war on technical debt includes implementing a proactive QA practice that prioritizes effective testing like identifying app defects after every activity or task or even testing automation.\n\nRefactoring\n\nWaiting around for things to fall apart is never a good strategy. Regularly re-writing components in software, in order to remove redundancies and optimize performance, might seem the very definition of technical debt–but, in this case, it is not. Refactoring code as a precaution will help increase its endurance over time, avoiding technical deb. Rather than wait for things to fall apart, savvy teams pre-emptively act to improve the code’s immune system.\n\nMotivate the team\n\nAccording to a\n\nrecent study\n\n, a company’s culture and management mindset play a key role in eliminating technical debt. In fact, motivation, encouragement, incentive, and reward programs have proved effective in keeping the development of software projects free from these frictions, while guidelines based on force and authority, as well as penalties, leave much to be desired.\n\nIn short, the challenge is to develop digital solutions in line with the needs and the market, properly planned to achieve long-term goals. Any faults detected must be repaired with adequate performance in mind and not just meeting deadlines. As a result, technical debt is kept under control and more complex problems are avoided. Achieving this balance between quality and time is a demanding but achievable goal.\n\nPartnering up to stay away from technical debt\n\nIt is not always possible to avoid technical debt, but when these occur within controllable frontiers, they do not generate severe consequences. The most important thing is to ensure that the team is not introducing debt irresponsibly, making it difficult (or impossible) to manage.\n\nWith these tips, you can save time in the future, keep a highly motivated and productive team and hold up your customers’ trust.\n\nAt Near Partner, our team of technical debt experts can go through your system and work on old “debts” while your teams devote resources to tackling future problems.

    "content": "A study with more than 300 companies named Near Partner one of the Happiest Companies in Portugal.\n\nAnd this is what it looks like from the inside. ?\n\nWe have big news!\n\nHappiness Works 2021\n\n, a study that assesses the level of happiness in organizations in Portugal, currently in its 10\n\nth\n\nedition, has ranked Near Partner in the top 20 happiest companies. We are extra proud to have been selected\n\njust a few days after our 4\n\nth\n\nbirthday\n\n.\n\nHappy Company 2021 Diploma – Near Partner\n\nThe selection process involved over 6.300 people in 300 organizations and required employees to take part anonymously. Questions ranged from\n\nwork life balance, leadership empathy, work atmosphere, corporate values, and purpose\n\n, and many other.\n\nIn short, the purpose was to answer one vital question:\n\nAre you happy working at Near Partner?\n\nTo celebrate this award, we wanted to give you a glimpse of how it really feels to work here. So, we asked around.\n\nWhat makes Near Partner different?\n\nOur CEO and Founder,\n\nPedro Veloso\n\n, always told us that “Near Partner was born from the notion that when good people come together, in a perfect blend of comfortable surroundings and interesting challenges, a virtuous circle of innovation emerges.”\n\nAs a result, “both the business and the individual prosper.” In Portugal, we have a wide pool of highly skilled programmers. This proved to be the cornerstone of our growth.\n\nFor\n\nDiogo Soares,\n\nour senior full-stack developer, what impresses him the most is “the fact that the company cares.” And he adds that he doesn’t remember having been in another company with the same level of care for the welfare of workers.\n\nWe are so proud of that! ?\n\nJean Lelis\n\nhas recently joined our team. He made sure to share his first\n\ncouple of months’\n\nimpressions with us. For him, “the culture is one of continuous development in order to have well-trained, motivated professionals with excellent technical skills. But the essence is the care for others.”\n\nIndira Sanches\n\nhighlights what for her makes Near Partner: “I feel I have a voice and that I can contribute to its success.” Isn’t that wonderful?\n\nAnd\n\nNuno Dias\n\nends with the most accurate summary of what makes us happy:\n\n“\n\nWe believe that good people, left at ease to work within the frame of the company’s culture, will do good things for customers, colleagues, and the company. That’s the Near Partner way.”\n\nHow would you describe Near Partner’s culture?\n\nFor\n\nIndira\n\n, it’s all about our\n\nresponsible informality\n\n. In her vision, “we are a company without many formalities, with a horizontal management and where relaxation and good vibes reign.”\n\nTo\n\nAfonso Dias\n\n, our baby developer (?) it’s the\n\nculture of trust\n\n– both inside the company and with customers.\n\nFor\n\nRute Pedrogão\n\n, our HR Manger, is of course all about\n\nPeople\n\n. She adds that “our team is made of amazing people. They are the ones who make the good work environment we live in, who come together to do things other than just working.” And she highlights another important topic that for us, as a team, which is a responsibility of everyone – The Emotional Salary. Obviously, Near Partner’s constant concern and availability as an organization are fundamental. But we must all play that role. Being available to help our teammates is essential to building happy and productive teams.\n\nA skilled pair of hands. Blowing off some steam from all that steaming OutSystems development at Near Partner’s HQ, pre-pandemic.\n\nAnd\n\nPedro Veloso\n\nemphasizes one simple principle: “we should all act according to what we think is best for the group. Each of us individually is part of the group and grows and improves with the group. We are a team, and we work along these lines.”\n\nWhat does a normal day look like at Near Partner?\n\nWe already talked about our\n\nresponsible informality\n\n, right? We are all different and that is why we assume each one has his own work method. Therefore, we leave it up to each one to decide how to organize their day, according to the expectations of the project in which they are in. Accountability and responsibility are key.\n\nTherefore, each person has a different routine.\n\nRute\n\ntold us how she started her day: “I turn on my laptop, give a shout out on our teams group channel, check the agenda and get to work. The normal day can be from 9am to 6pm or start in the early afternoon and go on until the evening. We have flexibility and that’s great.”\n\nIndira\n\nhas a slightly different routine. She starts with daily status meetings, which rarely exceed 15 minutes (\n\nyou already know we are Agile obsessed!\n\n). “I usually have time to focus on my tasks since I don’t have to stop for meetings. It is all very simple and not bureaucratic.”\n\nJean\n\nwas a little more philosophical on this one! ? For him, “the priority is meeting the trust and expectations my teammates have on me.” But there’s always room for interesting conversations with our colleagues for moments of learning, reflection, and relaxation, he adds.\n\nWhat was the last interesting thing you learned from your teammates?\n\nThere are several moments of conviviality in which we try not to talk about work. Whether in the office, in our weekly remote meetings or in all-hands meetings, we always try to share interesting topics with our teammates.\n\nSpoiler alert! Topics range from cryptocurrency to taekwondo.\n\nRute\n\n‘ last learning was about investments and cryptocurrencies. For\n\nJean\n\nwas about taekwondo and\n\nAfonso\n\nhighlighted the insights he had about “hard and soft skills”. As a junior developer, it was very important to him to gather a few tips on how to talk with Clients and how to improve and facilitate communication. He already knows that “sometimes a marginal evolution at that level can bring enormous improvements!”\n\nWhat was the biggest challenge you remember?\n\nChallenge is now our middle name. ?\n\nThe pandemic just refined our problem-solver mindset.\n\nBut working remotely has brought challenges never experienced by us. For\n\nRute\n\n, HR Manager, that was her biggest challenge. She said that “maintaining our team spirit, both with our current team and newcomers. Keeping team spirit in a 100% remote context is demanding, and the challenge continues…”\n\nJean\n\njoined the company during the pandemic under lock down. As you might expect, doing onboarding and adapting mostly from a distance was perhaps the biggest challenge.\n\nNuno\n\n‘s challenge was different. He will lead an external team to help them develop an online applications APP for schools, which will be used by tens of thousands of students. Cool right?!\n\nBut it is inevitable to return to the pandemic theme. For\n\nPedro\n\n, CEO, his greatest challenge was to grow without losing our identity, so that everyone would continue to feel comfortable, happy, and challenged to do more and better. The constant changes, of which the pandemic is the most visible example, showed us that the most important thing is that people feel good. For him, the challenge is not how much we grow, but how we grow.\n\nHow is Near Partner gearing up for the future?\n\nBy making sure that we continue to have all the conditions for people to grow and be happy here, said Pedro. Happy people are better at solving problems and facing challenges. We must make sure that the balance we have is maintained and people continue to feel good about the Near Partner.\n\nHappy people are better at solving problems, at dealing with new challenges, at innovation and simply… better at life. For us, this has always been a no-brainer. How would you like to work in one of the happiest companies in Portugal?\n\nJoin us!",

    "content": "Success stories start with good ideas, and good ideas are followed by a Proof of Concept. See how a PoC can facilitate the path to digital innovation.\n\nDigital innovation relies heavily on emerging digital technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Big Data,\n\n5G\n\nor machine learning. Because of that, it is actively changing the core of traditional IT. Technology and digital innovation are no longer viewed as catalysts for efficiency but as intrinsic elements of any business model. Just have a look at the\n\ntop app development trends for 2021\n\nand beyond.\n\nCompanies are realising that customer loyalty is no longer the (only) way to success. Customer needs are constantly evolving and there is added pressure to respond to the demands. And, with the need for growth and development—transformation, if you will—comes the need for digital innovation.\n\nBut evidently, digital innovation represents risks and challenges for any business. So, how can you kick-start digital innovation within your business\n\nin a way that minimises risk and creates a solid foundation for a successful project\n\n? Having had dozens of similar cases, we can confidently say the best approach will, at some point, involve building a proof of concept.\n\nWhat is a proof of concept?\n\nA proof of concept is a way of assessing the viability of a certain product for a specific business need. In other words, a proof of concept tries to validate whether an idea will work for a certain application. Although now used in most business contexts, “proof of concept” applies mostly to digital environments and comprises the basic framework of a software solution.\n\nIt differs from a prototype or a pilot, as the former is normally a test of how to deliver a product, and the latter has a much wider scope than a proof of concept.\n\nA proof of concept is the skeleton of an idea, much like a draft. It helps decision-making regarding whether to move forward to the pilot, prototype or even beta version. It isn’t meant to leave the backstage yet, nor to be tested by customers, but rather as a tool for the company to understand if changes need to be made or if something needs to be adjusted. Finally, a proof of concept can tell\n\nif and how a good idea can make it to application\n\n.\n\nFor example, let’s say a business that sells electric vehicles came up with a longer range, higher priced model. For the managing team to know the viability of the new product, they can launch a survey asking their customers if the new car they came up with sounds great and if they’re willing to try and buy one, or if it is just too expensive and beyond their reach. They may even draft a few sketches and put together a short video on the flashy new car. This important source of customer feedback would then help steer the development team towards product acceptance.\n\nAs a tool, PoC is widely used to\n\nimprove the consumer journey\n\n, among other aspects of the business.\n\nThe advantages of a proof of concept for businesses\n\nDeveloping a proof of concept is a\n\nfrequently overlooked step in developing a business idea\n\n. However, it is also extremely useful for companies and their process of digital innovation.\n\nA proof of concept brings many advantages to the table at an early stage of development:\n\n1. Risk mitigation\n\nA proof of concept is a\n\nsneak-peek into the future.\n\nIt tells a company if the project at hand is workable (for example, technology-wise), helps identify real-life limitations, identify gaps and loopholes, and decrease the risk associated with going full steam ahead towards a prototype.\n\n2. Resource management\n\nAt the initial stages of digital innovation, a proof of concept is an excellent tool to help businesses understand if there are enough resources to build an MVP. It is also a way to ensure that company resources and funds are not being wasted with a doomed, or below-average, idea.\n\n3. Investor onboarding\n\nInvestors need as solid evidence as possible before they get onboard with funding. Especially in cases of digital innovation, gaining allies is a stressful task. A proof of concept can help companies demonstrate expected ROI, elaborate a thought-through business plan and strategy, and also select the best software to move forward with.\n\n4. Upper management\n\nEven inside the business, a proof of concept for a digital innovation process is useful for stakeholders, heads of digital marketing, CFOs, and finance directors. When project managers propose a new idea, it is common for the upper management to have expectations of scalability, and if so, whether it is immediate. With a proof of concept in place, it is easier to manage expectations across the company.\n\n5. Quicker decision-making\n\nA proof of concept, as opposed to a prototype or pilot, has the important advantages of being quicker to create and less costly. In theory, it could be developed in a matter of hours or days, not weeks or months. This allows for important, time-consuming decisions to be made still in the proposal stage, and the rest of the journey towards digital innovation becomes smoother.\n\n3 golden rules for a flawless Proof of Concept development\n\nAnd while a proof of concept is a rapid outline of a certain project, some effort does go into it. These are the 3 main rules to keep in mind while striving for impeccable digital innovation:\n\nAgile is the way.\n\nThe Agile method is your friend if you want to do things fast, efficiently and with consistent results.\n\nAgile\n\nprioritises software that works and allows for fast changes, instead of a fixed, immutable plan. Just like a proof of concept, paving the way for digital innovation.\n\nLow code is the foundation.\n\nIt is difficult to separate Agile and low code development. And in the case of building a proof of concept, you shouldn’t. It is\n\npossible to create an entire software on low code\n\n, but you can also create the skeleton of an app very quickly. Low code also makes it much easier to implement changes and to test software. And the best part? If you start with a low-code-based proof of concept, you can easily move on to prototyping, to MVP, and all the way to launching a successful, customized, working software.\n\nJust get in touch with our team to find out how.\n\nThe right resources.\n\nAlthough a proof of concept is the barebone of a project, a simple idea has a long way to go before it reaches that stage. It is important to find the right resources along with the tools, from the very early, concept, stages. In some cases, that might mean relying on a trusted external partner to beef up your internal team.\n\nChoosing the right Partner in Digital Innovation: from PoC to success\n\nDo you need help or guidance in building a solid proof of concept for your business? Or simply put the development in expert and experienced hands instead? At Near Partner we can help you in both scenarios. We have extensive experience with customers in various businesses. Check our\n\nsuccess stories\n\n.\n\nNot even sure where to start? No problem. With our\n\nOutSystems\n\n,\n\nSalesforce\n\nand\n\nSoftware Dev services\n\n, our team of developers will be happy to brainstorm ideas, point you in the right direction technology-wise, and explore a proof of concept that works for your business and market.\n\nQuoting Elon Musk,\n\ngood ideas are always crazy until they’re not\n\n, and we are eager to make your crazy idea become a success.\n\nGet in touch\n\n!",

    "content": "Loads of platforms, scores of methodologies, and many cryptic concepts.\n\nAfterall, what are the core features a modern app development software must possess?\n\nSo, you’re looking for an app development software. It must cater to your needs\n\nand\n\nprovide you with enough flexibility to run your business whenever, wherever. The choice is, to put it mildly, monumental. Understandably, it is quite easy to feel lost and confused.\n\nSettling on one single app development software is a complex task that requires weighing in an array of factors. Focusing on these 7 features allows business managers to narrow down their options from tens or even hundreds of programs to the vital few that suit their needs – even those that might not be apparent at first.\n\nApp development software\n\nwith the right features\n\nIf you’re unsure of what to look for in an app development software, there are 7 key features every business manager should consider.\n\n1.\n\nLow-code app development\n\nOne of the most appreciated qualities of low-code app development software is the faster delivery time of web and mobile apps. And while this is one of the big advantages of low-code, it is not the only one. The popularity of low-code is on the rise since this method enables non-technical departments to get directly involved in development—especially with enterprise-grade apps. This allows companies to increase productivity while simplifying the entire app development process. This is\n\nhow enterprise-grade low-code speeds up Time to Market\n\n.\n\nStill on the fence about low-code? See\n\nall you can build with low-code\n\napp development software.\n\n2.\n\nDeployment options\n\nThere’s a lot to be said about on-site vs. cloud-hosted app development software. Both offer different opportunities and pose distinct challenges. As an example, cloud programming has long been regarded as the safest choice for data storage since it allows for far greater redundancies. However, the\n\nrecent rise of ransomware attacks\n\nhas shed a new light on the dangers of having sensitive information in the cloud, which is again turning some companies to local servers and storage options.\n\nSo, it is important to check whether each app development software allows you to make that choice. Is having total control—and total responsibility—over the development and deployment of your apps important? Or do you prefer more support and unrestricted access? Is there room to change your mind mid-development and should you prioritize flexibility?\n\nAt Near Partner,\n\nour team\n\ncan guide you through the options that best suit your business model. We have hands-on experience working with leading companies around the world that are on the forefront of the battle for cybersecurity and data privacy.\n\n3. Native support for Agile development\n\nSpoiler alert if you are new to our blog: we love Agile (\n\nreal Agile\n\n, we mean). In this day and age, Agile is the way to go and, and low-code and Agile go hand-in-hand (and if not, they should).\n\nJust take a look at\n\nOutSystems\n\n: the whole method is Agile-based, and this is one reason why Outsystems is one of the most popular app development software in the world. The Agile development method is helping business deal with a fast-changing landscape of requirements, customer preferences, and technological updates. A modern app development software must offer native support for Agile development.\n\nSource:\n\nMcksinsey\n\n4. Integrated debugging\n\nThere is an entire world of debugging to choose from–from tips & tricks to online courses, workshops, best-practices, and so on. When building an app, the debugging part can be quite time-consuming even for the best developers. Because of this, although not so easy to find, a modern app development software should include a debugger integrated in the platform to facilitate the developers’ efforts and allow backend users more freedom. Think about this when choosing your app development software.\n\n5. Scalability through APIs\n\nAs organisations grow, the number of users or server requests will definitely increase as well. To ensure that your app development software has the ability to grow with your business without harming response time and throughput, make sure it offers an architecture that supports both vertical scalability (add more resources to the same server) sand horizontal scalability (add multiple servers).\n\nSource:\n\neducative.io\n\nPreparing for scalability also means your app development software should allow for API (Application Programming Interface) to be set in place. An API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. In other words, an API is the messenger that delivers your request to the provider that you’re requesting it from and then delivers the response back to you.\n\nAn API defines functionalities that are independent of their respective implementations, which allows those implementations and definitions to vary without compromising each other. Therefore, a good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing the building blocks.\n\nIn a similar way,\n\nwe’ve helped the marketing team over at Globenet\n\n, a leading telecoms company, grow their Salesforce-based apps effortlessly amongst both sales teams and customers.\n\n6. Real-time monitoring of app performance\n\nThe aim of a good app development software is to offer their users control over the entire application development cycle. Somethings to keep in mind while browsing for an app development software are real-time monitoring, test environments, feedback, dashboards, and other management tools.\n\nOutsystems is one such tool\n\nand our team can help you get the most of it. With Outsystems, everyone can take the first step, but speeding to the final destination requires a safe pair of hands – such as our very own Outsystems MVP and Champion!\n\nGet to know them\n\n.\n\n7. Excellent integration capabilities\n\nAnd finally, if you aren’t starting from scratch, you’ll want an app development software that integrates seamlessly with all your legacy systems, and with others you might need or want to use. This includes voice assistants, messaging platforms, REST, SOAP, databases, or cloud services. Also, look for compatibility with any device—which, in this multichannel world of today, should be a native feature. At Near Partner, we are always looking for new ways to perfect our\n\nSalesforce and Outsystems skills\n\nto deliver our customers the very latest in integration modules and responsive experiences.\n\nOur advice?\n\nAt Near Partner we’ve worked with many platforms in hundreds of projects. Our consensus as professionals in the app development field is we totally stand by OutSystems.\n\nIn a nutshell, OutSystems provides:\n\nsuper-fast time-to-market;\n\nerror-free in-cloud or on-premises app deployment;\n\nreal-time monitoring and reporting of performance and usage;\n\nscalable applications through APIs;\n\ncomplete DevOps automation;\n\nintegration with over 250 systems;\n\nnative support for Agile development;\n\nintegrated debugging engine;\n\ndedicated security incident response team;\n\nWant to know a bit more about OutSystems?

From Portugal to the world, we specialize in software development to help you pull off your next project with less stress and less cost. Our team has the know-how to power you at every stage of your project development life cycle, from scratch to launch.\n\nGet to know us\n\n.\n\nLet’s dig a little deeper into OS and see why it could be a game changer for your business.\n\nAdvantages and key functionalities\n\nDefinitions aside, OutSystems is not just an app development platform. Here are a few of its major benefits for businesses:\n\nResponsiveness\n\nMaking a responsive app is easier with OutSystems. That goes for mobile apps as well. If you’re looking for a bulletproof way to get your iOS or Android up and running in no time, OutSystems is the way to go.\n\nFlexible integration\n\nOutSystems platform integrates easily with any system, web service, database, or app. The platform offers interfaces to programs and systems such as SAP, Salesforce, Azure, Active Directory, Oracle, SqlServer, MySQL, iDB2, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, ZenDesk, Paypal, Twillio, Quickbooks, UPS, Okta, Box, DropBox, Amazon EC2, Google Drive… You name it.\n\nRapid development and deployment reduce the total development time of an app from several to a couple of months. With its “keep it simple” attitude, OutSystems enables developers to handle changes in a few days or even in a few minutes. As a result, OutSystems can lead to a 75% reduction in development-associated costs and up to 4 times faster development!\n\nSee how\n\nenterprise-grade low-code speeds up time-to-market\n\n.\n\nCustomisation\n\nOne thing that OutSystems doesn’t have is vendor lock-in. Yep, you can expand the platform easily with extensions or even by adding your own code. All modules are open-code, and the community contributes to the OutSystems Forge repository–there are thousands of contributions already.\n\nWe have already done some interesting customization projects, here is one of them:\n\nCan I Have Custom Dashboards in OS Applications?\n\nScalability\n\nNeed to grow? No sweat. OutSystems architecture supports both vertical and horizontal scalability. Depending on your and your business’ needs, you can increase server requests or the number of users without delaying response time.\n\nMonitoring and Metrics\n\nOutSystems built-in tools make monitoring and troubleshooting as easy as ever. You can visualise analytics about the user experience, see logs of apps, collect, and manage users’ feedback, audit IT tasks and usage, while also having access to metrics on performance.\n\nSecurity\n\nAnd… the major concern for many, security. OutSystems is a very secure platform, out of the box. It provides built-in security technologies that support the entire application development process, stable code patterns that protect against vulnerabilities, and automatic software security that identifies risks.\n\nSince OutSystems is scalable, integrative, expandable and customisable, you bet there are modules and solutions for every type of business. Explore OutSystems Forge and see for yourself!\n\nFull portability\n\nOutSystems can run in its own cloud or any other public or private cloud. As a user, you are free from any provider, as the platform is fully portable. Why? Because OutSystems generates every module in its toolbox via open development stacks.\n\nHow to make the most of OutSystems\n\nKnowing what OutSystems can do is one thing. Knowing how to use it strategically is where the real value lies. Here are some practical ways to maximize the platform.\n\nStart small, scale fast\n\nDon’t try to rebuild your entire IT ecosystem on day one. Begin with a high-impact but contained use case, like a customer management app, a workflow automation, or a tool to streamline marketing campaigns. Once the quick win is in place, it becomes easier to expand.\n\nConnect with what you already use\n\nOne of OutSystems’ strengths is being an integrated platform. Link it with your CRM apps like Salesforce, your marketing automation tools, or even your ERP. This ensures your business processes flow across departments without manual gaps.\n\nEmpower your teams\n\nWith OutSystems, even small businesses can create apps without needing armies of developers. But the best results happen when your sales team, customer service, and IT co-design solutions together. That way, you’re building around actual needs, not assumptions.\n\nLeverage AI and automation\n\nThe platform integrates seamlessly with AI agents, chatbots, and advanced analytics. Use this to speed up decision-making, personalize emails marketing, or simplify sales customer service. Build intelligence into your customer relationship management CRM platform.\n\nMeasure, learn, improve\n\nEvery app you build in OutSystems generates data. Tap into the Marketing Cloud Customer Data Platform or built-in dashboards to monitor adoption, usage, and customer satisfaction. Think of it as a loop: design, deploy, learn, improve.\n\nDon’t go it alone\n\nOutSystems reduces complexity, but advanced projects still benefit from expert support. Working with a specialized partner ensures you avoid pitfalls, optimize performance, and get the most out of Platform as a Service (PaaS) capabilities.\n\nStill unsure of how and where OutSystems can help your business?

    "content": "In the past year, most companies have experienced disruptions in the way they conduct business. As changes become more permanent, we bring you our own view of the future of work at Near Partner, for 2021 and beyond.\n\nIn the past year, the expression work from home became so widely used it earned its own acronym, WFH. Companies around the world had to adapt quickly to remote working.\n\nTwitter allowed all employees to work from home “forever”.\n\nFacebook, Shopify, Square, and Slack soon followed suit\n\nwith similar announcements. Big tech leaders are not alone–\n\n19% of founders see remote work\n\nas a viable approach to the future of work.\n\nCritics, however, were\n\nquick to point out that moving towards remote work might come at the expense of employee collaboration and ‘serendipity’,\n\na term that describes chance encounters, discussions and brainstorming between employees that drive creativity and new ideas.\n\nEven before the pandemic struck, companies such as the\n\nBank of New York\n\nmade headlines when they told their staff that they were scaling back their ability to work from home. The bank’s announcement followed decisions by IBM, Yahoo, Aetna and Best Buy requiring those working from home to return to the office.\n\nAt Near Partner, we faced a similar choice. Therefore, we long for a swift return to the office.\n\nWe value a sense of Oneness\n\nHow can you begin to define ‘company culture’? For many, it’s the total of their ways of working, standards of behavior and interaction. And it is essential to build shared trust.\n\nAs we contemplate remote work as a long-term solution, we look to harness the experiences of others who blazed the trail and then scaled back. In 2013,\n\nYahoo!’s CEO Marissa Mayer acted on that same concern\n\n, effectively ended the company’s remote-working experiment, observing that the company needed to become “one Yahoo!” again.\n\nWe share that same concern. Although we have always been remote friendly, for us,\n\noffice culture is everything\n\nand, once the pandemic hopefully blows over, we look forward to those relaxed moments together, and working side by side on tough challenges. Just look at these smiling faces.\n\nSmiling faces. This is what office culture means to us. Either at work or play, together we are stronger.\n\nSchedule flexibility has always been the norm for us\n\nThe future is flexible. But for us, the past has been as well. Employees expect schedule flexibility and goal-oriented work plans. That’s how we feel at Near Partner. You get to choose.\n\nWe work with clients around the world. They are in different time zones, so we all have different schedules. Each of us has the flexibility and responsibility to manage his or her own time. Therefore, we don’t need to control schedules or even define rules for how, when or where we work.\n\nOur strong culture is key to deliver successful projects remotely\n\nDelivering successful development projects remotely is what we do here at Near Partner. Working with Near Partner, businesses access a far-reaching pool of coding talent. Clients are happy to tap into the exceptional skills of our Portugal-based teams.  Doing so requires a strong company culture centred on our teams’ needs.\n\nAt Near Partner, we take the mission of uniting our people seriously. Pouf Talk is our monthly all-hands meeting. Characterized by informality, before the pandemic, these meetings took place either in the auditorium sitting on the floor or poufs, while eating a croissant; or even sharing a table over dinner while having a few beers. Now, as we work from home, we do it anyway through Microsoft Teams. It is not the same thing but we try to make it lively and full of surprises!\n\nThat looks interesting. A brainstorm session at the start of 2020.\n\nTo keep our teams solid, we regularly maintain One-on-One meetings. They are the backbone of our culture. This is a 30-minute meeting between two team members where they talk about everything but work. The aim is to communicate in an individualized way. It is a safe space where we go through deeper conversations and get to know each other better.\n\nLast and not least, we have our dear Miss Marple–an app to share and getting to know the people we work with. Miss Marple sends us three emails per week and the questions vary depending on the topic: What’s up question on Mondays, a Personal\n\nquestion every Friday and a Company question on Wednesdays\n\n.\n\nHere at Near Partner, this allows us to be more productive and happier–both at work and in our personal lives.\n\nOur office culture fends off isolation\n\nBeing at home all day is dangerous. A feeling of detachment can settle in and ruin both work life and personal life. Talking to people via email only is an open invitation for isolation. By checking in at the office we fend off isolating, and ultimately detachment from our colleges, ambitions, and clients.\n\nThe good old days. At an event at Near Partner before Covid-19.\n\nWe are “Remote Friendly”\n\nThere is no doubt that this experience has shown us that remote work can be a great ally for many people and families.\n\nFor others, not so much.\n\nThat’s why it’s up to us, as a team, to respect each other’s needs and make it work!\n\nSay you cannot make it to the office, for whatever reason. Your children need you to stay put or a family member is sick. We get that, in some scenarios, commuting to the office is just not reasonable. It’s not like coming in is coded into our brains. We chose to be office-based but remote working is, of course, a possibility and every team member has that flexibility. So long as they let their team know, that’s fine too.\n\nBut for us, our hope is that remote working is the exception, not the rule.\n\n“We are neither eight nor eighty”\n\nThis is a Portuguese old saying that perfectly sums up the vision of our future: “We are neither eight nor eighty”.\n\nWe are right in the middle.\n\nTo wrap up this post, we recognize that there is a clear trend towards full remote, which we respect. On the other hand, we have all those companies where, as soon as the pandemic breaks down, returning to the office isn’t a choice. As for us, we continue to choose to listen each member of our team and to decide together what is best. We have always been like this and always will be!\n\nOur office will always be a space for sharing and community, which will never cease to exist. We will continue to provide a place where we can aspire to be and work together!\n\nWe are firm believers in the power of culture. Of being together and sharing the good and the bad. This why we long to be united in the office once again.\n\nGet in touch\n\nand find out how Near Partner can help you and your business. Ask us anything.",

    "content": "Digital transformation is no longer just an idea. It’s happening everywhere.\n\nThese are the top challenges companies face, and how leaders can handle them.\n\nDigital transformation is happening all around us. While in recent years it seemed like something that would slowly happen “in the future”, COVID-19 in 2020 has forced us to go through the digital transformation process in a few months. Well, not\n\nall\n\nof us\n\n.\n\nNot to sound cheeky, but at Near Partner we boarded the digital transformation bandwagon years ago, because we are geeks like that. But for most companies the world over, Covid-19 was in fact\n\nthe biggest driver of the digital transformation\n\n. Ever.\n\nAnd what do businesses get from a rapid adoption of all\n\nthings digital\n\n? For one,\n\nenhanced data collection\n\nwill\n\nincrease\n\nagility\n\n, provide\n\ndata-driven customer insights,\n\nand allow\n\ngreater resource management. Also\n\n, companies benefit from an\n\nincreased profitability\n\npowered by a jump in\n\nproductivity\n\n. The advantages of embracing (rather than just\n\naccepting\n\n) the digital transformation are many, but they all translate to one thing: the\n\nability to respond to market demands and customer needs\n\n. And thus, staying ahead of the game.\n\nBut just because we are living it, it doesn’t mean everything is running as smoothly as it should. Some businesses, big or small, are struggling with either implementation or maintenance, since\n\ndigital transformation is not a one-off process\n\n. In fact, the entire purpose of digital transformation is to create flexible organisations that are ready to embrace relevant digital tools as they emerge. A company that fully embraces digital transform should keep up with technological progress rather than stagnate after a breakthrough.\n\nDigital Transformation is that sweet spot where People, Tools and Processes meet. Source:\n\nIntel\n\nExpecting the benefits of digital transformation to come overnight is naïve and might set you up for failure. It will take some time, some effort and multiple adaptations before your company gets the results. If we could use a metaphor, we’d say digital transformation is the journey, not the destination. It is important to keep the “bigger picture” in sight and drop the short-term wins and gains. A patient but paced approach is key for digital leaders–and also a great way to tackle all the challenges that come with digital transformation.\n\nWhat are the challenges with digital transformation for companies?\n\nEvery company feels some challenges, regardless of size. These are the\n\n5 key challenges\n\nstemming from digital transformation, and how to confront them.\n\n1.\n\nDigital Transformation is a seismic cultural shift\n\nDigital transformation is not just about software upgrades and fancy tech in the office. It is about transforming the way we work, making the most out of digital tools and embodying a digital-first mindset. Most companies with doing all the above without losing sight of the human experience. Digital transformation requires significant changes, some of which might end up being resented by employees, or even customers. And what is the best way to avoid this? Simple: communication. Always communicate with your teams and explain how the entire business will benefit. With your teams on board, this ship sails smoothly.\n\n2.\n\nFriction in digital adoption is bound to happen. Deal with it with communication\n\nIt is tempting to assume that today’s workforce comprises only digital natives, but that’s not always the case. Senior employees and those unaccustomed to digital tools such as field operatives, may encounter hiccups in the adoption of new tools and technologies. The solution here is to increase fluency in technologies and tools your business deployed, be it through formal or informal training. Investing in your workforce is investing in your business’ success. After all, it is people who fuel the digital workplace. With that in mind, here at Near Partner we have a ‘no man left behind policy’. That means our experts provide training to make sure no one feels excluded from the process. Digital transformation may feel like a seismic cultural shift, and thriving requires involving everybody, every day.\n\n3.\n\nGoing nowhere fast is a problem. Develop a digital transformation strategy\n\nNot having a digital transformation strategy is one of the biggest challenges so far. Because of market pressure, companies need to deliver software applications faster to their customers. As a result, there is a tendency to focus more on the tools than on the performance improvements that markets and customers crave. While choosing the right tools is important–check out some\n\napp development trends for 2021 and beyond\n\n–so is to have defined goals and metrics. With a data-driven digital approach, metrics and strategy matter more than ever. Ever heard of low code?\n\nThis is what you can build with it\n\n.\n\n4.\n\nNo dedicated IT expertise? No problem\n\nNot all businesses and organisations can afford a full-fledged IT department. And a small, dedicated, in-house team is likely not versatile enough to address every challenge. Besides, in the ever-evolving world customer needs, developing internal skills to keep up to with market demands is a serious challenge. Once leaders factor in costs and budget constraints, the whole endeavour risks being written off as a pipe dream. But fear not, one way to avoid this challenge is to consider hiring expert software consultants to supplement and guide your in-house team. This is exactly what we do here at Near Partner. Long story short, we can help make your business development vision come true in a few days or weeks, rather than months.\n\n5. Overcome budget constraints with simple yet effective development\n\nFinally, digital transformation typically requires investing. Be it purchasing hardware like new PCs or tablets for the office, network equipment, or servers, cloud services, DevOps, technical support, training, it has associated expenses. So, you and your business need to plan–if only there were a digital transformation strategy in place, hm?\n\nOne clever way to bypass some of the challenges in this area – we mean, drastically cut down costs – is precisely by taking advantage of the recent trends in business and technology, such as low-code platforms. At Near Partner, we can’t recommend Outsystems and Salesforce enough. These are two of most powerful yet simple low-code technologies to get your project off the ground.\n\nMaking Digital Transformation easier\n\nSome of the challenges of digital transformation might seem overwhelming and the absolute end of your project. Allow us to disagree. With the right tools in place, as well as the right guidance, your business can thrive and overcome whatever challenges the transition to a digital-first world may throw in its way.\n\nThat being said, this transformation is not optional. The only choice is whether your business embarks in the transition train and embraces the changes, or if it fights it and trails behind along with the slow-moving peers. So, do not let challenges stop or hinder your business and your project.\n\nIf the journey becomes too overwhelming,\n\ncall\n\nus. At Near Partner, we are used to tackling challenges, help our customers implement new tools in their evolving businesses, and also to brainstorm the best way to make this transition to digital-first happen seamlessly. Our\n\nteam\n\nof\n\nOutSystems developers\n\n,\n\nSalesforce experts\n\n, and\n\nsoftware developers\n\nis always ready for a new challenge.\n\nDon’t know exactly how we can help?\n\nTalk to us\n\nand let’s figure it out together.",

    "content": "We are possibly approaching the post-pandemic phase of our lives, but what does that mean for app development? These trends will set the scene for 2021 and beyond.\n\nThe\n\npandemic brought many changes\n\nto our lives. Some businesses faced stark choices on whether to remain open. Others fared slightly better and continued serving their customers. A few exceptions grew exponentially.\n\nAcross the board, one thing was clear: companies had to adapt. One priority stood above all others-the need to rethink the\n\ncustomer experience\n\n. To do so, companies have turned to responsive and native app development. And however painful these changes were at first, some of them ended up sticking around–and becoming a new reality.\n\nMobile adoption boomed in 2020, having advanced\n\nalmost three years in 12 months\n\n. In that period, the three most popular app stores (iOS, Google Play and Third-Party Android in China) registered 218 billion new app downloads. Some areas saw exceptional growth. Finance apps downloads, for example, increased by 15% while health & fitness apps grew 30%. The time spent in business apps is even more striking: a growth of over 200% compared to the first trimester of 2020.\n\nREPORT – The State of Mobile 2021 by appannie.com\n\nThe world’s appetite for smartphones is ever growing. For shopping, banking, entertainment, or to work. And although the pandemic seems to have an end in sight, some habits, consolidated for more than a year now, will persevere. So, it won’t come as a shocker to hear the future is mobile. And if the future really\n\nis\n\nmobile, what does it mean for app development?\n\nApp development macro trends on the rise in 2021\n\nThese are some of the main app development trends that IT leaders and users alike point out as top priority for 2021 and beyond.\n\nLow-code development\n\nCompanies are rediscovering low-code, a software development approach that enables the delivery of applications faster and with minimal hand-coding.Low-code platforms are a collection of tools that enable the visual development of applications through a graphical interface. They let developers skip hand-coding, speeding up app production.App development with low-code has really taken off over the last few years. Even giants like Google, who just recently acquired a no-code application building platform, seem certain that low code and no code apps are here to stay. The tech giant is not alone. Gartner now predicts that low code will represent 65% of all app development by 2024.\n\nSalesforce apps\n\nSalesforce offers a wide range of tools to help businesses partake in custom app development, fully compatible with its excellent CMR. These solutions include Salesforce Lightning, Force.com, Salesforce App Cloud, or Salesforce Mobile Publisher, which enables developers to publish apps for the Apple and Google app stores.\n\nSalesforce tags all these app development platforms as either low code or no code, since they allow users to create apps without having to write a single line of code. And let’s not forget Salesforce Einstein, Salesforce’s very own artificial intelligence software that puts the AI cloud within reach of\n\ndevelopers\n\n.\n\nWearable app development\n\nThe wearables trend keeps growing: according to Gartner, consumers spent $69 billion in wearables in 2020, worldwide, and the forecast is $81.5 billion for 2021. The key drivers of the wearable’s popularity were, unsurprisingly, the COVID-19 pandemic since remote work and distance health monitoring became a necessity.\n\nNow, the end of the pandemic seems nearer(-ish). However, wearables are not going anywhere. It’s not just about smartwatches and smart bracelets–although these still have much undiscovered potential. Estimates show that wearable app development will evolve into virtual reality headsets, augmented reality glasses, shoes and clothing, and even skin (epidermal) electronics.\n\nM-commerce\n\nMobile phones and tablets accounted for\n\n69%\n\nof all e-commerce sales back in 2019. With the rise of mobile (or should we say the jump?), opportunities multiply, and it is only natural that ecommerce turns to m-commerce.\n\nM-commerce differs mobile-responsive e-commerce since apps are born mobile – us techies call these apps “native”.

    "content": "By now, most business leaders have heard of Salesforce, the leading CRM in the world.\n\nBut do you know what is CPQ in Salesforce?\n\nCompanies around the world follow a similar macro sales process. The first step is usually\n\nLead Generation\n\n, followed by\n\nProspecting and Qualification\n\nof those leads. Shortly after, in B2B or B2G (business-to-government) sales, businesses Develop a Solution, and offer a\n\nPresentation and/or Proposal\n\n. Two last steps wrap up the sales process:\n\nNegotiation\n\nand\n\nClosing\n\n.\n\nEach stage reduces the\n\nnumber of leads that makes it to the next round, creating a “funnel” effect\n\n.\n\nFunnel vision. The typical B2B or B2G sales process, in 7 stages. Source:\n\nFit Small Business\n\nEach stage comes with its own set of challenges, selling points, and pitfalls. In particular, many growing businesses struggle with the Proposal stage – which requires business to present a compelling proposal that woos the customer.\n\nTo aid in this step, Salesforce, the leading CRM software house in the world, designed a purposely built tool called CPQ. This is how it works and why it may suit your business needs.\n\nConfigure, Price, Quote… Go!\n\nCPQ stands for Configure, Price, Quote. CPQ in Salesforce is a software package specially targeted at sales reps, that the entire team can easily use. It is a powerful tool that allows quick and accurate pricing within any product configuration scenario.\n\nCrucially, CPQ in Salesforce provides a lot of out-of-the-box features such as the ability to schedule discounts. One feature product managers will appreciate is the possibility to set pricing rules based on product quantities or to link accounts directly to partners, to reflect changes on their platforms. This Salesforce package also simplifies the process of configurating new products at scale, via its Bundle Products configuration. Also, Contracting and Order fulfilment is easier with CPQ in Salesforce, with ready to use processes to create Orders and Contracts.\n\nThe purpose is to shorten larger B2B or B2G sales cycles, which can take several months from first contact to closing. Also, Salesforce has developed a tool that increases the hit rate of proposals, the number of accepted proposals divided by the number of these documents that your company churns out. All this while increasing the team’s productivity by reducing manual tasks and eliminating error-prone activities. For instance, CPQ comes with a Quote Documents feature that allow sales reps to quickly generate Quotes, in pdf format, from a pre-built template. This saves time, eliminates mistakes and, most importantly, increases proposal acceptance rate.\n\nBut since no two customers are the same, CPQ in Salesforce considers the need for a customised approach to any sale, so it allows the automation of the process, without sacrificing a personalised experience for your customers. Sounds great, right? But wait, there’s more.\n\nTop benefits of using CPQ in Salesforce\n\nBesides the obvious results–more accurate pricing, quicker and more personalised quotes, and fewer errors and delays in product and client configuration–CPQ in Salesforce offers a myriad of benefits for its users.\n\nShorter sales cycle\n\nCPQ in Salesforce uses guided selling to direct sales representatives throughout the\n\nsales process\n\n. The result is an improved quote accuracy that leads to a shorter sales cycle. According to Aberdeen Group, CPQ users out-perform non-CPQ users, specifically in shortening the average sales cycle from over 4.5 months to just below 3.5.\n\nIncreased deal size, up-sell and cross-sell\n\nCPQ in Salesforce tracks your customer preferences and–with a brilliant mix of automation and AI–suggests the ideal combination of products and services. This can help increase the deal size, increase cross-sell and up-sell, and build up a stronger customer base.\n\nResource maximisation\n\nBy streamlining essential processes like submitting proposals, or delivering quotes, CPQ in Salesforce helps your sales team to spend more time with the customers, with every contact adding value to the interaction. This means less wasted time and resources, and more focus on other tasks in your sales department.\n\nBoost in sales\n\nThe CPQ in Salesforce provides intelligent insights and reports that help you improve your sales endeavours. How? The platform automatically adjusts prices according to drifting market rates. It also produces performance and profitability reports within the CPQ tool. All of which contribute to an optimised sales process.\n\n5 tips to take the most out of CPQ in Salesforce\n\nTake advantage of the complete package\n\nCPQ in Salesforce is not only a sales tool. It is a very complete software that works best with other Salesforce software. When used with\n\nCRM solutions\n\n, the sales process becomes even more seamless, as every step becomes a part of the same workflow. It reduces errors and delays, and your sales reps can send proposals to prospects in record time. Partnering DocuSign, a digital signature app, CPQ in Salesforce can email a contract to a customer requiring a digital signature.\n\nDon’t bail on proper configuration\n\nMost CPQ users focus more on the automation part of the software when they should pay equal attention to its customisation and configuration abilities. With CPQ in Salesforce you can set personal goals for your business, check if those goals are being met, and why or why not. Configuration and implementation is easier with CPQ, which reduces Time to Market.\n\nLive CPQ in Salesforce to the fullest\n\nSalesforce is a universe of possibilities, but some require a bit more expertise than others. Learning about the software is essential to make the most out of it and reap all the benefits. So don’t shy out and seek expert help!

    "content": "In March 2020 COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, triggering a worldwide public health emergency. The impact on people, health, businesses, and other pillars of the global economy is unprecedent!\n\nThe virus was spreading at a breakneck pace (still is, unfortunately), and governments around the world have implemented several restrictive measures to curb its spread. Portugal, for example, announced mandatory quarantine on March 17, extending it for over 50 days. During that period, just like many countries around the world,\n\norganizations were forced to shut down or send their employees home\n\n.\n\nThe pandemic forced us to completely\n\nchange the way we live and work\n\n. This change was difficult for most of us… I’m sure you can relate. One thing we learned in this period of crisis is that different people react differently to complexities and uncertainties, including feelings of loss of control, anxiety about well-being and conjectures around insecurity.\n\nHowever,\n\nwith a strong company culture and leadership\n\n, it is possible to give your team the confidence and comfort to continue their best work. We are proud to say that, as a team, we have been getting through this crisis without affecting our work and the relationship with our clients.\n\nThis was possible because long before this, we built the foundations to be resilient to change. How? We built agile teams, with a strong and focused work methodologies.\n\nIn this article we share some practices we have adopted over time that are helping us overcome not only the pandemic but many other obstacles that emerged in professional day to day. I hope that it will inspire you to build organizational flexibility using the Agile methodology to emerge stronger from this period of insecurity.\n\nBut first… let’s talk about the Agile Methodology\n\nAgile was born in 2001 when 17 technologists drafted the\n\nAgile Manifesto\n\n. They wrote four major principles for agile project management, with the goal of developing better software:\n\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools\n\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\n\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation\n\nResponding to change over following a plan\n\nThis methodology was created to help organizations increase speed in project development, have greater flexibility and focus on the customer relationship. This approach to software development management was so successful that it inspired several functions across organizations to practice the agile methodology, or a version of it.\n\nHere, at Near Partner, we are big believers of Agile. Camilo wrote an entire blog post about it:\n\nAgile Development: what being agile means to us\n\n. This article talks about what Agile means to us and how we deal with this methodology in our daily work. It also talks about the most common misconceptions when we are talking about Agile.\n\nOur experience has shown us that, as Camilo says, the word “Agile” says it all. Things are not “always” or “never”. Projects change. Situations change. The environment is different. Sometimes, some ceremonies might not make sense. Sometimes agile may not even be the best option. Agile is the means to get you there, not the end.\n\nBut let’s talk about what brought you here.\n\nAs I mentioned before, we are big fans of Agile software development and we believe that this methodology is the reason we dealt so well with this massive change.\n\nCurrently, we are slowly returning to the office and entering a new phase: part of the team is telecommuting and another in the office (we gave our team the freedom to choose how they prefer to work).\n\nI don’t know if I can say that we are in the aftermath of mandatory remote work, but we are at a stage where we already see the light at the end of the tunnel. It is safe to say that we can look back and see that the balance was clearly positive. Why? We had Agile on our side.\n\nLet me share 4 reasons why Agile was instrumental in this drastic change in the way we work with our clients:\n\n1. Agile allows for quick shifts\n\nI know… I have mentioned this multiple times across this blog post. Sorry about that! But it is a critical element of this approach. You don’t need a world health crisis to realize you need to be flexible. Every time you need to make quick adjustments to priorities, approaches or the content of work, Agile is the way to go!\n\nIn Agile we “break” projects into pieces. We break down project development into small increments that minimize the amount of up-front planning and design. By completing tasks bit by bit, it provides the opportunity to make any corrections or simply change the course of action whenever things are not going as planned.\n\nBecause work has been planned, with iterations over shorter time frames (typically last from one to four weeks), you can manage any bump in the road you may find along the way (in this case a gigantic crash that is coronavirus crisis).\n\n2. Agile provides rhythm to work\n\nDo you know that trendy song that plays continuously on the radio? The one who, even if it isn’t your jam, you end up knowing the lyrics from beginning to end? Well, repetition has these things – you end up getting into the rhythm.\n\nAgile can be something like that! The repetitive core of an Agile development methodology provides structure and keeps the project moving forward, even when problems pop up. Why? Agile is based on sprints that include repetitive events called rituals. These rituals are scheduled on the same day of the week for every sprint. After a few weeks, everyone on the team knows what to do and when to do it—and a rhythm is established.\n\nSo, when things are unclear and nothing seems normal, Agile provides systematic standards for getting the job done. Whether doing a daily stand-up or planning the next sprint, these rituals bring a much-needed sense of normalcy and, ultimately, elevate your team’s mood!\n\n3. Agile is customer-centric\n\nThe crisis was particularly hard for companies. The uncertainty put many projects on the shelf, and many others were left unfinished. But those who had the courage and the means to\n\ncontinue to innovate\n\n, were the adventurers who made us realize how much customer-centric Agile is.\n\nNow let’s see.\n\nWe all know that the customer doesn’t always know what he wants… Usually only when he starts to interact with the product, is when he really understands his needs. Therefore, is essential to deliver the product as quickly as possible. Because development is phased, we can keep the customer engaged, and he can give us constant feedback to make sure we are on the right path.\n\nThe ceremonies are another key element of the relationship. These rituals bring a lot of clarity into the requirements and a better understanding about the work that is expected from the team. Conducting these ceremonies correctly will help you improve the quality of the process and the product.\n\nSo, never forget the old maxim, “the customer is always right”.\n\nToday, when uncertainty prevails and options are many, involve your client in the development process. Agile techniques will only help you build the perfect partnership with your Client!\n\n4. Agile is empowering\n\nAnother cornerstone of Agile is to empower all team members. Agile is a collaborative, iterative and transparent process. This means that all stakeholders are updated on assigned tasks at regular intervals, provide feedback, and then the team knows what needs to be changed or improved. Together, the team discusses the problems and comes up with a solution.\n\nThis allows teams to decide on the fly, rather than asking for permission or waiting for managers to make the assessment.\n\nThese rituals maintain a level of information capable of ensuring speed and responsiveness to customer needs. COVID just added more pressure to these projects. Reacting even faster gave the necessary leverage to deal with the current circumstances.\n\nDoing Agile vs. Being Agile\n\nWhen the pandemic exploded, we could understand perfectly who was doing Agile and who was being Agile. We all managed to define processes, create tasks and have daily meetings.\n\nHowever, to truly solve problems and be ready for quick shifts, you must first understand the culture and mindset behind this methodology. The practices behind Agile is just the system that sustains and supports agility in the long run.\n\nBeing agile has more to do with who we are, our essence. It is something that is built and diluted in the organizational culture and exudes in the pores of each member of the team.\n\nWe are agile. Yes, I am sure of that. Today, more than ever, I know that we can and will overcome any roadblocks, hurdles, and problems, to successfully deliver the project.\n\nSo, take advantage of this amazing methodology to help you get through these crazy times.

    "content": "Is the consumer journey really that important? Now more than ever. If you’re asking yourself this question, there are probably a few myths that need debunking.\n\nIn early 2020, as the first lockdown measures came up in the news, Diogo Cruz, Co-Founder of\n\nEZFY\n\n, a cloud-based Healthcare company, realized the world had changed.\n\nInstinctively, Diogo knew the changing times demanded swift change. Were the company’s strong financial performance and 100-strong partner community enough to shield it from the changes ahead?\n\nA few weeks later, Diogo contacted Near Partner with a simple question. If our lives and routines are not what they used to be, how can the consumer journey stay the same?\n\nThey haven’t, and it hasn’t. In fact, it’s now more important than ever before. Especially since customers are more aware of it.\n\nGoing digital–forcibly or otherwise–has put the consumer journey front and center for businesses everywhere. The way companies approach it is in the spotlight, and most importantly, under scrutiny.\n\nIn an era where so many businesses are online,\n\ncustomer acquisitions costs are on the\n\nrise.\n\nPeople are more willing to trade e-sellers for benefits\n\nsuch as discounts or free shipping, potentially pushing companies to slash prices and cut down margins. In this competitive atmosphere, organizations that excel at supporting their customers gain a competitive advantage and stand apart from their peers.\n\nNot surprisingly with such abrupt change, several myths surrounding consumer journey have gained prominence. For companies keen on truly improving their consumer journey, the time has come to cast these myths aside.\n\nConsumer journey\n\n: the myths, the truths, and the right path\n\nEveryone struggles with change. One of the things we struggle about is knowing whether the need for change is real. That’s why myth busting is so important. Here are 4 myths that may be holding you down, as digital transformation goes.\n\nMyth #1. Omnichannel is meant for large organizations\n\nBusted! In fact,\n\nomnichannel everything\n\ncould be a game changer for many companies, in a variety of sectors and sizes. Customers expect to have a seamless experience across platforms and channels, and why shouldn’t they get it?\n\nA brand or business must feel like a whole coherent, unified entity, regardless of platform. Multichannel alone doesn’t cut it anymore. It’s time to step up the game.\n\nSavvy companies learn about their consumer journey while going through the way people interact with different, isolated channels to identify chokepoints.\n\nHowever, achieving omnichannel’s potential requires attentive engagement, consistent and excellent customer service, and complete communication across channels.\n\nThis is where the right CRM tool comes into play. Salesforce, the world’s leading CRM software, gives your organization the power to grow, scale and improve your workforce productivity and customer satisfaction.\n\nAt Near Partner, we have the experience and know how to implement, re-engineer your projects and improve the way you do business through Salesforce.\n\nMyth #2. A digital-first business is only for new players\n\nNope. Not only for new players, and not only for big players.\n\nThe way we shop is changing and most purchases now start online\n\n(yes, even B2B), making digital-first a top priority for leaders.\n\nBut what does digital-first actually mean? It’s more than having a website or e-commerce. It’s about changing a company’s culture to place digital at the heart. In a digital-first company, business management activities are digital first. Internal processes and communication too. And the same goes to Consumer journey, where all road leads in the end.\n\nIt might be easier for new players to have a digital-first business model, but established organizations can make the transition as well. It has happened all around us during this past year where we’ve all seen how large organizations were quick to leap to the digital world faster than anyone thought possible. How?\n\nRemember EZFY, the healthcare company where Diogo works? As a healthcare company that develops customized programs that promote the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological therapies, becoming a digital first business was a top priority.\n\nAt Near Partner, we are\n\nproud to have deployed Health Cloud\n\n, a Salesforce integrated system, improving the communication among sales team, patients, and providers. Doing so required streamlining Marketing activities, automating back office tasks automatized and enhancing data visualization. In short, EZFY now provides faster and more intelligent service on the customer’s preferred channel.\n\nAnd no, you don’t need to a be in tech to be a digital-first business. Digital-first could very well translate to customer-first, and this is transversal to all business models.\n\nMyth #3. Digital pushes sales teams to the side-lined\n\nThis is probably one of the more pervasive myths: that going digital means people come second place. If you believe that, re-watching Terminator might bring some clarity–remember how in the end it’s people and empathy that actually save humanity?\n\nSo, we’ve moved pass the notion that the rise of the machines will eradicate human workers. The fact is, there’s no replacement for a great company culture, the kind that’s created by talented, creative humans.\n\nLike the culture we have here at Near Partner, for example. Last time we checked, we are not humanoids deprived of improvisation or empathy skills. We do believe technology is a great complement to the work developed by our talented teams. And yet, somehow, we manage to get along with each other and do funny things together like, you guessed, re-watch Terminator over and over. I mean, can you believe they’re not going to do another one?\n\nAre sales teams really that different? Digital tools, such as a\n\nCRM\n\n, can help salespeople add value to the customer’s consumer journey. At the same time, digital helps buyers find solutions, compare alternatives, and evaluate their purchases on a self-service basis, freeing up time for humans to add value. The human side is always key.\n\nSalesforce can ease the Backoffice load of your sales teams. For complex processes that require a skilled hand, our team at Near Partner loves challenges and work alongside sales and marketing teams worldwide.\n\nJust get in touch with an expert Near (aha!) you.\n\n#4. Everything will be back to the way it was… pre-pandemic\n\nWhile some fear it, others long for it: going back to “normal”. Ahh, those lost days where people actually crammed into shops fighting it off for the last piece in their size.\n\nFunny thing about that, though. Experience from countries such as China, which suffered through a SARS pandemic back in 2002-2004, shows us that actually things don’t go back to normal. In fact, digital uptake continued to grow after that period and today, China has one of the most digitalized economies in the world.\n\nIn 2019, China online sales totalled at 44% of all purchases made in the country\n\n. In Europe that number was around 14%.\n\nGoing back is just not happening.\n\nWhile we certainly hope we can get back to our normal personal lives soon, we know that in business there is no going back.\n\nThink about it: this whole situation – which has driven\n\nthe biggest digital transformation to memory\n\n– has changed internal processes, the way buyers interact with businesses, the way businesses market their products or services, and it has changed consumer journeys immensely.\n\nCustomers are now used to a new, improved, and integrated customer experience, to constant support and customer service from businesses, and to essentially have more control over their experience. So, no, when it comes to the consumer journey, everything will\n\nnot\n\nbe back to “normal”.\n\nThe good news is that we can shape what the new normal looks like – and it’s going to be great!\n\nConsumer journey\n\nmapping and managing with Salesforce\n\nBut how exactly can you improve your consumer journey and live to tell the tale?\n\nThere are many, many tools available to help companies track buyers’ journeys. However, the keyword here is integration. To successfully implement a customer relations strategy, companies need to not only gather as much info as possible, but to use it wisely to create an engaging Consumer journey.\n\nOne of the best tools for effectively guiding a customer’s consumer journey is Salesforce. It not only gathers the data that businesses need, but it also helps to identify patterns in clients and prospects, allowing businesses to tailor their approach to customers.\n\nAt Near Partner we are Salesforce enthusiasts. Our certified developers are\n\nfluent\n\nin Salesforce and ready to face any challenge that might come along. Heck, we love designing and delivering Salesforce solutions that will empower you to make the right decisions for your business.\n\nContact us about our\n\nservices for Salesforce\n\nand find out how we can help you take your business to the next level.",

    "content": "Hard skills are a vital part of every developer’s skillset. As the profession changes however, so do expectations for software engineer skills.\n\nSoftware engineer skills are not what they used to be. Software engineers in recruitment sessions today are being asked how they can help companies adapt to circumstances changing at breakneck pace. And how their presence will improve the team’s performance as a whole.\n\nThe demand shift in software engineers from a mostly technical background to a broader, human-minded profile is part of a growing trend. IT chiefs around the globe are setting their sights on candidates with a strong set of soft skills.\n\nThese are the\n\nhot soft skills a software engineer is expected to master in 2021, according to CIOs.\n\n1.\n\nCommunication\n\nIn a world where everything is moving to digital, it can be easy to lose track of what’s “real” and what’s virtual. The market demands\n\ncloseness, contact, communication\n\n.\n\nA\n\nmuch-requested\n\nsoftware engineer skill, communication is defined as the ability to talk and listen, openly, unhinderedly, and with ease. That goes for both the internal team as well as directly with the customer.\n\nAnother key software engineer skill that goes hand in hand with communication is\n\napproachability\n\n. Being approachable is very important in a context where communication between people and teams is needed.\n\nAt\n\nNear Partner\n\nwe encourage everyone to develop their skills and enrich their knowledge, especially via active communication with team mates and team leaders. For this particular reason, and to make it the rule and not the exception, we’ve implemented the\n\nOne-on-One\n\nroutine (or O3 as we call it) in our office.\n\nA One-on-One is a periodical 30-minute meeting (more or less), usually between a manager and a team member, with the goal of building trust and relationship. This is where we uncover potential issues, share and ask for feedback and connect as a team.\n\nWe also encourage choosing the best possible communication channel for each topic at hand. It’s all about being considerate of other people’s time, before we engage. That’s why we try to\n\nmake communication as efficient as possible\n\n. One of the ways we do that is by switching between synchronous comms – phone calls, meetings – and asynchronous (such as chat, text, email). It depends on whether we’re brainstorming a new project, or simply ordering take out.\n\nBut don’t write us off as communication robots just yet. There’s plenty of room for surprises, laughter and happiness in our communication.\n\n2.\n\nTeam spirit and collaboration\n\nIf you have ever been inside an IT office, then you know what we mean. Software engineering is highly collaborative, as we often work in teams. But teamwork won’t take you as far as team spirit –\n\nworking with others is different from\n\nthinking\n\nwith others.\n\nWith team spirit come trust, empathy, ability to listen, and the ability to accept and provide criticism, and working together towards the same goal. These might not strike you as essential software engineer skills, but for us at Near Partner, these soft skills are what keeps us working without friction.\n\nWe believe team spirit is a big of our culture, and that’s why all the teams at Near Partner are part of a larger, united group – and yes, we might even\n\nrun marathons together\n\n.\n\n3.\n\nFast – and eager – learning\n\nThe world changes fast and software engineering is no exception.\n\nSoftware engineers need to learn new things every day, from new projects to new techniques, meeting demands and adapting the way they work. Being a fast – and eager – learner is a\n\nmust have\n\nsoftware engineer skill nowadays.\n\nIt’s not about just keeping up; it’s about embracing change\n\nand thriving on it.\n\nWe strongly encourage our developers to leave behind the doctrines they’ve learned, to be\n\ntechnology agnostics\n\n. To be ready to abandon the routines they’ve trained in and make way for creative mindsets. As you might suspect, we are big fans of\n\nAgile (done right)\n\n.\n\n4.\n\nFlexibility and adaptability\n\nOne of the most important software engineer skills in the job market today is flexibility.\n\nCIOs expect a developer to be comfortable moving between different areas, from integration to deployment.\n\nJob descriptions are fluid, not stagnant\n\nand they require flexibility.\n\nSometimes, a software engineer needs to work with a team that is right there next to them. Sometimes he/she needs to collaborate with someone on the\n\nother side of the world\n\n, a person they’ve never met or worked with before, with a diametrically opposed mindset and background.\n\nHow software engineers navigate personal differences to work together as one is an\n\nimportant to CIOs in today’s competitive job market\n\n.\n\nThis ability to jump back and forth between\n\nteam and self, creative and methodical, or simple to complex\n\nis what makes software engineers thrive as part of a team.\n\n5.\n\nCreative problem solving\n\nThis might seem redundant since software engineering is all about solving problems. However, as the software industry becomes more integrated with business, the challenges are ever-growing, and demand soars for creative and effective solutions to trickier problems.\n\nUsing past experience, formal methods, and theoretical knowledge to solve problems is the basis. But nowadays software engineering requires creativity, critical thinking, and a fair amount of risk taking.\n\nAnd this can be achieved through learning, adapting, questioning, and resilience.\n\nCIOs need\n\nproblem solvers\n\n– for them, setbacks teach valuable lessons and risks are opportunities do better, to do smarter.\n\nWhy are these 5 skills so crucial? Sure, they sound like a good thing, but what makes them really important for IT?\n\nThey’re necessary to help software engineers pivot from a support to a strategic business part.\n\nWhen IT was separate from business, software engineers were resorted to in a reactive fashion, and didn’t really need sharp soft skills. But as IT is getting less and less siloed and bleeding into all areas of a company, tech professionals have to adapt and be able to work across teams and departments. They also need to explain the value of their work to different stakeholders.\n\nThe good news is that you can develop any skill, hard or soft, with ongoing work and effort. And, if you take a closer look, these 5 software engineer skills complement each other, and each skill makes the next easier.\n\nAre you equipped with these software engineer skills – or really, really keen on developing them? Come along and\n\njoin our team\n\n. We are always looking for talented developers with bright minds, so be sure to check out our open positions, or send us a or send us your CV so we can contact you whenever your profile matches our search criteria.",

    "content": "is not just another buzzword to throw around the business world. Find out what it means and why your business needs it.\n\nFew methodologies have swept the tech world as fast as Growth Hacking. Entrepreneurs, VCs, founders, managers and journalists alike see it as a pathway to faster, more sustainable growth. Why?\n\nIn tech years, Growth Hacking is not a new concept. Having been around since 200\n\n8, it’s about the same age as\n\nthe IPhone.\n\nThe term was first coined by entrepreneur, angel investor, and startup advisor Sean Ellis. You might associate him with Dropbox and that’s because he helped bring Dropbox and other startups to market. Ellis is also the founder and CEO of GrowthHackers.com.\n\nWhat exactly is Growth Hacking?\n\nFor starters, it has nothing to do with anything illegal.\n\nGrowth Hacking is a set of marketing strategies focused on rapid growth. It translates to a\n\nstrategy of acquiring as many new customers as possible in a short amount of time, while spending as little as possible\n\n. Cool, right? Here’s how it works.\n\nDropbox pulled a great growth hack in their first years of existence. The “hack” was essentially a trade – free storage space in exchange for customer referrals. Dropbox rewarded their users with 125MB of free storage space for a single follow in their social media platforms. Also, the company awarded 500MB for each referral when the invitee signed up. The cloud storage pioneer also gave away a few tens of GB in online contests, scavenger hunts or “races”.\n\nThe trick worked: As millions of users got free storage with just a few clicks, Dropbox saw sign ups increase by 60%. Their Twitter base grew close to a million followers. Today, Dropbox has over 500 million users worldwide, with a market cap in the neighbourhood of 10 billion dollars.\n\nDropbox’ impressive early growth: when growth hacking techniques meet the right product. Source:\n\nTechcrunch\n\nSo it worked for Dropbox, but will it work anywhere else?\n\nGrowth hacking is not exclusive to startups, tech companies, or new players. It’s also not just about handing out free stuff. Everyone loves a freebie, but still, there’s a bit more to it to make it stick.\n\nWhile the typical growth hacks might appear to be all flash, there’s a lot going on backstage. The work and ideas that make the shiny hacks happen, for example, easy sign ups, collecting and rewarding customer feedback or Omnichannel marketing.\n\nGrowth Hacking\n\n101: becoming a growth hacker\n\nContrary to what you might think from TV shows such as Mr. Robot, becoming a growth hacker has more to do with meticulous planning and processes than mystery and magic.\n\nIt is about making sound business decisions and getting all the help you can from different departments towards a shared purpose. Gaining new customers at lightning speed and zero cost.\n\nInternalise Agile processes\n\nYep,\n\nAgile again\n\n(we love it!).\n\nAnd while some may say Agile and Growth Hacking are not compatible, we disagree. Do you remember the four pillars of the Agile Manifesto? Most, if not all, of Agile processes focus on efficiency, productivity, and teamwork and are, of course, result-oriented. And growth hacking, while solely focused on (fast) growth, needs these to run smoothly.\n\nMake adjusting as easy as possible\n\nTo grow, companies need to adapt. Fast. This means responding to customers’ demands as quickly as possible. And as\n\nwe’ve seen in the last year\n\n, customers’ needs can change overnight. And the response must be, well, overnight as well, or you risk trailing behind. Being able to implement changes and make adjustments quickly and painlessly is very important to a growth hacking strategy. What better than low code to achieve it? Check how\n\nlow code is speeding up time to market\n\n.\n\nGet iterative customer feedback\n\nRemember, there isn’t a math formula for growth hacking, as every business is different.\n\nHowever, if there were to be a formula, a big part of it would be customer feedback. This is the most valuable resource a business can have. So, go get that customer feedback, and incorporate it into your project or products, in rapid, iterative development cycles.\n\nAce customer preferences with A/B tests\n\nAnd still on that math formula, A/B testing is another key point for growth hacking. It is a kind of customer feedback in an indirect sense. Who knows what they like more than your clients themselves? Implement A/B testing in the most conversion-heavy areas of your website, such as landing pages, sales pages, homepage and even contact page.\n\nHowever, although useful and almost always leading to a win-win scenario, A/B testing can become quite overwhelming really quickly. Pro tip: focus on one area of each page at a time. Too many variables make it much more difficult to evaluate the results and to know what works and what doesn’t.\n\nAttract with interactive content\n\nInteractive content increases customer engagement. And customer engagement is pretty much the first step in the ladder to growth hacking.\n\nIt’s undeniable that content marketing is king nowadays, and it’s also undeniable that there are a lot of good ideas out there, so businesses need to add a differential to their marketing strategies. How about\n\nmaking it fun\n\n? Accelerated growth requires companies to stand out.\n\nThat being said, growth hacking is not an exact science. There are, however, do’s and don’ts. It is also safe to assume that it’s not enough to have a good idea – or even a great product. Sometimes luck plays a part but there’s no such thing as dumb luck in growth hacking. As in many other things, luck favours the brave.\n\nTo hack growth hacking, your business needs to be ready to take flight. If you would allow us an aeroplane analogy, you can’t just send an aeroplane off and hope it gets where it has to go. There is a whole team, or rather several teams working together, behind a flight.\n\nThe picture bellow shows just how much cross functional goes into Growth Hacking.\n\nThe maze of Growth Hacking skills and techniques.

    "content": "Ever wondered what a Salesforce developer does? Here at Near Partner, we happen to know a few of them. Say hello.\n\nMeet Valter Abreu. He has been working at Near Partner since mid-2019. A big fan of flexible workhours (who isn’t really), Valter has been to every edition of Websummit since it landed in Portugal. Last year, he lost the coveted prize of Office Comedian to Camillo Penna, but that’s a whole other story.\n\nValter is a Salesforce developer, specializing in Salesforce deployment methodologies. He describes himself as a “roll-up-your-sleeves technologist who thrives in a think-tank like environment”. That sounds fancy, but what does it really mean?\n\nSalesforce is the world’s leading\n\ncustomer relationship management (CRM) platform\n\n. The US-based company achieved this status by uniting marketing, sales, commerce, service, and IT teams from anywhere with one integrated platform that powers an entire suite of connected apps. With Salesforce, corporations can focus their efforts on what’s important right now: stabilizing their business, reopening, and getting back to delivering exceptional customer experiences.\n\nThe salesforce platform in a nutshell. Plenty of high-sounding names here but it boils down to one word: app integration. Source:\n\nSalesforce\n\nTo better understand what all this means, we turned to Valter, hoping he could explain with a touch of humour. How does a Salesforce developer solve companies’ problems? What are the key skills one must possess to succeed?\n\nLet’s take it from the top.\n\nWhat are the key skills of a software developer?\n\nFirst of all, let’s start with the skills. Valter was quick to identify the characteristics that make a great salesforce developer.\n\nLanguage skills\n\nLanguage skills are important to a salesforce developer, just not the kind that works well on vacations. Salesforce requires developers to master a handful of particular programming languages. Apex is Salesforce’s proprietary programming language with Java-like syntax. Visualforce is a markup language that lets you create custom Salesforce pages with code that looks a lot like HTML. Becoming a successful Salesforce developer requires mastering these programming languages, and a few more universal others: JavaScript, HTML, and SQL.\n\nBut, Valter adds, becoming a Salesforce Yoda also requires mastering another type of language: business talk. A typical Salesforce project involves solving broad business issues. It requires programmers to understand the whys behind the what.\n\nTake\n\nQMC Telecom\n\n.\n\nQMC is one of those companies we use everyday, without knowing it. They design, build, own and operate Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS), cell towers, rooftops, and small cells that enhance mobile connectivity.\n\nWith over 2,500 assets installed and under development, QMC works behind the scenes with an extensive array of partners including shopping malls, hotels, hospitals, educational facilities, transportation infrastructure and airports, so we all have network on our phones.\n\nQMC’s\n\nsleek\n\nwebsite. QMC Telecom works in the background to bring you unlimited connectivity.\n\nQMC contacted Near Partner to synchronize information between CRM and Operations with Salesforce. Crucially for QMC’s 200 internal users, communication between sales teams,\n\noperations and providers needed overhaul unification\n\n.\n\nSolving this problem required the team of Salesforce developer to understand how the business works, the customer’s fundamental needs, and what mattered the most to its staff. It also meant analyzing relevant business as well as legal requirements, something you might not associate immediately with a Salesforce Developer.\n\nTo make sure everything ran smoothly, we also deployed a project management team to support our Salesforce Developers. They were the ones ticking all the boxes, making sure deadlines were met, strategizing and prioritizing. When the smoke cleared, Salesforce Sales Cloud seamlessly connected what had once been several isolated processes.\n\nTranslation skills\n\nCommunication, when dealing with clients, business owners, and business managers is not a “plus” but a must. Salesforce developers work closely with people with limited programming background so a good Salesforce developer must be able to articulate the steps taken. It requires him or her to translate what’s being asked from business language to Salesforce language.\n\nAt some point, a Salesforce developer will have to work with pretty much all the departments of a business, from marketing to sales. Understanding management jargon and its inherent priorities is essential. Projects are usually time sensitive and fit into a bigger picture of corporate strategy, which requires developers to sympathize and adapt quickly.\n\nSalesforce fluency\n\nA Salesforce developer must be all-things-salesforce-fluent. We mean Visualforce, 3rd party integration, customized function development, Lightning App Builder, Force.com, Lightning Components, and so on. But also fluent in configuring CRM products like Sales Cloud or Service Cloud.\n\nBecause of this, Salesforce developers are highly skilled professionals. They are software developers that have branched out to master Salesforce technology in all its dimensions. High demand and specialization means that hiring a Salesforce developer can be an onerous task for a business. This is where Valter and his colleagues here at Near Partner come in. Businesses can have access to decades of compounded experience and deliver a solution to the market in record time without the responsibility of hiring a team themselves. Recently, we created a\n\nguide on how to speed up time-to-market with low code solutions\n\nsuch as Outsystems and Salesforce.\n\nIn short, becoming a Salesforce developer requires a perfect blend of hard and soft skills. The process of becoming one is neatly summarized by Salesforce themselves. Have a look.\n\nBecoming a salesforce developer looks rather simple right? In fact, a proficient coder has many hours under his or her belt. Source: Salesforce\n\nWhy are Salesforce developers in such high demand?\n\nSalesforce is very intuitive and user-friendly. In fact, it democratised the access to CMRs with its Sales Cloud solution. Virtually all businesses can make use of it, without a big IT department. And, sure, any business will still benefit from the basic features of a Salesforce platform.\n\nHowever, Salesforce is not just your basic CMR (some would say it is a way of life). Tailoring Salesforce to a business specific needs requires in-depth expertise only a Salesforce developer can provide. In sum, personalisation and customisation is why Salesforce developers and consultants are in such high demand.\n\nBut what do Salesforce developers do exactly?\n\nEvery business is unique and so are their specific needs. But let’s try to illustrate what a Salesforce developer does with a quick example.\n\nOne of the most basic tasks you can automate with, say, the Sales Cloud platform is to send a follow-up email to your clients, a few days after a purchase. Even emailing a reminder of an abandoned shopping cart is quite simple and can be programmed with ease. These are tasks anyone can perform by themselves–with or without knowledge of software development or programming of any sort.\n\nWhat if you want to track your customer’s interactions with your, for instance, blog posts, and send them personalised marketing emails or exclusive deals based on the blog categories theyinteracted the most with? This is absolutely possible to do with Salesforce, but you will probably need a Salesforce developer–unless you have unlimited time to figure it out yourself.\n\nSalesforce potential goes even further. Create if/then tasks based on user behavior? Check. Email automatic quotes directly to the customer, without human intervention? Positive. Establish a process of automatic approvals, based on pre-defined criteria? Certainly.\n\nIn short, a Salesforce developer helps a business set up and configure their Salesforce platform and customise it to the business’ very own needs. It also helps the business users to adopt the various Salesforce platforms and take advantage of all the features to grow the business.\n\nDoes your business need a hand managing customer relationships? At Near Partner\n\n,\n\nwe are Salesforce Consulting Partner and we have a “very particular set of skills”.\n\nContact us about our Salesforce Services\n\nand find out what our talented salesforce developers can do for you and your business. Are you simply curious and would like to know more about what a Salesforce developer could bring to the table?\n\nGet in touch!\n\nAs Salesforce consulting partner, we love to brainstorm–all our developers are professional brainstormers and idea-bouncers–about the potential of Salesforce platforms.",

    "content": "Jordan is the Vice President of Marketing at Reciprocity Labs and manages the company’s go-to-market strategy and execution. Prior to joining Reciprocity, Mr. MacAvoy served in executive roles at Fundbox, a Forbes Next Billion Dollar Company, and Intuit, via their acquisition of the SaaS marketing and communications solution, Demandforce.\n\nRemote working is quickly gaining popularity, globally, primarily due to the\n\nCOVID-19 crisis.\n\nHowever, while telecommuting provides location flexibility, it has several data security challenges. Employees may use unsecured WiFi and unprotected devices that put your business data at risk. Fortunately, you can create a solid plan to protect your data and enjoy the\n\nbenefits of remote working\n\n. Here are seven effective ways to monitor sensitive data in remote work:\n\n1. Establish A Remote Data Security Policy\n\nThe first step in protecting your data is ensuring that all your employees understand your data policy. Some employees may be unaware of their role in protecting company data. Having a policy will educate them about their position and their duty in data security.\n\nFirst, conduct a\n\ncyber-security audit\n\nand risk assessment to see where you stand as a business? Do you have a policy in place? Do your remote workers have data security training? Do you have any emergency response plans? Do you have a secure back up for company data?\n\nA thorough assessment of your business will help you know all your data, your risks, and how your employees play into each part. Once you create the policy, ensure that all your employees read it and ask them for feedback. Remember also to ask your employees to sign the policy.\n\n2. Create Secure Connections\n\nUnsecured internet connections are one of the easiest ways for hackers to access your information. Think about all the people you find typing away inside coffee shops? Any of these people could be your employee clearing some work on the café’s internet. Unfortunately,\n\n61% of employees\n\nconnect company-owned devices to public WiFi in airports and hotels.\n\nEach of these connections presents opportunities for hackers to intercept your information. To secure your data, normalize using a virtual private network (VPN). This software encrypts all your data, which prevents snoopers from knowing what you do online, even on a public network.\n\nHowever, remember that not all VPNs offer equal services. Consult with a professional or with your IT team to find a VPN that has all the covers you need.\n\n3. Use Multi-Factor Authentication\n\nYou should also consider setting up multifactor authentication protocols to ensure that only employees have access to your data. Two-factor authentication, for instance, requires that the users pass two steps before they can access the system.\n\nAnyone can steal your worker’s password and gain access to their laptops when they are away. However, if the second step requires a security question or a crammed pin, it’s harder to guess. You can take it further by using biometric data to identify employees. Facial identification, fingerprints, retina, and voiceprints are unique to individuals.\n\n4. Encourage The Creation of Strong Passwords\n\nDespite being mentioned for several years, weak passwords remain a common entry point for hackers. According to\n\nVerizon’s Data Breach Investigations Report\n\n, 2019, 80% of cyber-attacks were tied to passwords. This is barely a decrease from 2017’s report, which showed that 81% of breaches happened due to weak and compromised passwords.\n\nUnfortunately, most people cannot remember several long and complicated passwords, which is why you should use password managers. You can then create different strong passwords for various systems and have one overall password for your remote workers to remember.\n\nHowever, remember to continually encourage your workers not to jolt down their password and remember to change it frequently in case it’s compromised.\n\n5. Use an Encryption Software\n\nEncryption software is useful in instances where an employee misplaces a company device. In case the burglars plan to access your information, you can encrypt the data, which automatically prevents access. Additionally, you should enable end-to-end encryption for any platform you use for formal and informal chats. Lastly, remember to encrypt the documents you share with your remote employees.\n\n6. Update Your Software\n\nAnti-viruses, anti-malware, and firewalls are a great way to protect your business. However, if you forget to update your software, you create weak links that hackers can utilize. Since your employees work far from you, remember to provide technical support online. The support team will remind your employees to install new updates or all devices, including their mobile phones.\n\nRemember also to specify the software your employees use to secure their devices. Only use trustworthy software on your work devices. Ask the employees to follow the protocol and provide assistance to acquire the software if necessary.\n\n7. Shift to Web-Based Applications\n\nUsing cloud-based services shifts the burden of cybersecurity since most providers have strict cybersecurity protocols and updated software. Ensure that you select a provider with sturdy security procedures. If you require assistance to find the right cloud-based platforms, consult a professional.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nTo ensure that you enjoy the full benefits of remote working, remember to have data security strategies in place. Begin by creating a sound cybersecurity policy, updating software, enabling multi-factor authentication, and using VPNs, password managers, encryption software, and cloud-based platforms.\n\nWritten by Jordan McAvoy, from\n\nReciprocity Labs.\n\nOur Blog is a space for knowledge and self-improvement, with educational content, both from us and other amazing authors.

    "content": "In mid-September last year, our CEO – Pedro gave me a massive challenge: organize a Leadership training for a High-Performance Team! This sounds complex but let me explain the thought process behind it and what I have learned along the way.\n\nMy first step was to make sure that everyone was on board with the idea. For this, I conducted a survey to better understand what their training areas of interest, expectations and what schedule were would be better for them. At the same time, we were all concerned about the amount of time that we would need to allocate to this training, without harming our daily work schedule.\n\nBased on the survey answers, we split our team in 2 groups. Each group had sessions every 3 weeks, 2.30-hour long. The good practices say that training sessions should be held in the morning because there is a tendency towards a greater predisposition of the trainees. On top of that, these sessions should be closely monitored and announced as much as possible overtime.\n\nAnother important aspect of this training was the person who was guiding these sessions. We wanted someone who was inspiring and trustworthy. As soon as we started to talk with Coach Luís Silva we knew he was the man for the job! ?\n\nCommunication toxins and antidotes\n\nIn the mentioned survey, I could understand that many of them wanted to improve their communications skills, team building, leadership and, not surprisingly, many would like to lead teams in the near future (and we love that aspiration!).\n\nSo, the first and most anticipated topic was… [insert drum roll here] –\n\nCommunication\n\n!\n\nCommunication is the basis of any relationship and a cornerstone of a high-performance team. So, we started to approach the\n\nCommunications barriers\n\n, which for us automatically means\n\ntoxins and antidotes\n\n. We learned that there are 4 defined\n\ntoxins\n\npatterns:\n\nBlaming/Criticism –\n\nAttacking the person rather than the behaviour.\n\nDefensiveness –\n\nRefusing to own your own behaviour.\n\nContempt –\n\nIncludes sarcasm, belittling, cynicism, name calling, and hostile humour.\n\nStonewalling –\n\nIncludes cutting off communication, silent treatment, refusal to engage, withdrawal.\n\nFor each one of these toxins we have the so-called Antidotes. In other words, ways of ease the situation by replacing these toxins with more constructive and healthy behaviours. Let me give you a few examples:\n\nBlaming/Criticism\n\nIt’s easy to fall in a situation where we criticize someone’s character or complaining about a failed behaviour rather than attacking their argument. Attacking someone with the famous “what’s wrong with you” is fairly common… For this toxin, we choose to address the behaviour and not attack the person. So, start the conversation in a gentle but assertive way, and talk about what those actions made you feel (and try to use more “I feel… I want…” statements).\n\nDefensiveness\n\nNo one likes to be criticized… but we are in position to choose how we react to it. Defensiveness is protecting yourself from criticism, exposure of your shortcomings, or other real or perceived threats to the ego. The problem with defensiveness is that its perceived effect is blame. It’s like saying: “The problem is not me, it’s you.” That’s why it is so important to have an active listening and believe in the 2% rule. And what’s this rule? We all should treat any complaint as if 2% of it were true.\n\nContempt\n\nWe all have been in a situation where you are debating something with a teammate, and he is rolling his eyes… I’m sure this also made you feel neglected and insignificant. It’s crucial to understand the impact of Contempt, because this is the most poisonous of all toxins – it destroys psychological, emotional, and physical health. The antidote for this toxin should start from the beginning of any relationship. How? By building a culture of appreciation and respect in your team. If you regularly express appreciation and respect for your teammate, you’ll create a positive perspective in your team that acts as a buffer for negative feelings. The more positive you feel, the less likely that you’ll feel or express contempt.\n\nAnd remember the 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions. If we have five or more positive interactions for every one negative interaction, then we are adding regular deposits into our emotional bank account, which keeps our relationship in the green. ?\n\nStonewalling\n\nCutting off all sorts of communication, silent treatments, refusals to engage or withdrawal. Do you recognize these behaviours? Unfortunately, they are common. To this toxin, the most valuable antidote is transparency and respect. Be honest if something made you feel blamed or criticized. And if you are seeing someone in your team having this behaviour, intervene. You can be the mediator of this situation and ultimately help your team have a better relationship!\n\nYou will fail, be aware of that\n\nSomething that we´ve learned along this training is that no one is perfect, and at some point, we all use toxins to justify our behaviour. If we assume this by default, it will be easier to apply the antidotes whenever any of these toxins appear in a work or personal situation. And we saw it happen pretty quickly.\n\nA few days after this session, at lunch, someone spoke more sharply, although it wasn’t with bad intentions. However, it was interesting how quickly we remember the antidotes for that action. Not only we addressed it lightly, but we ended laughing of the way we handled the situation and just applied what we had learned.\n\nEmpathy is not\n\nsympathy\n\nThe next topic in our learning program was empathy. And I must confess… I realized that\n\nempathy\n\nisn’t sympathy. Yes, it’s true! Empathy is recognizing emotions in others, not judging. It’s having the capability to put yourself in others’ shoes.\n\nDid you know that empathy can be communicated verbally and non-verbally? Non-verbal empathy occurs 65% more than verbal empathy. We need to be aware that when we speak to someone, our posture and gestures also “speaks” and shows how empathetic (or not) we are.\n\nWhat is your Team Culture?\n\nOne of the most interesting sessions was to reflect on the type of team we are and what we should do to reach that high-performance team status. There are 4 types of team culture based on Positivity and Productivity:\n\nAt the beginning of this exercise, each of us had to choose which quadrant best suited our team. Then choose where we would like to be in the long run. This allowed us to reflect on the team’s dynamics, productivity, and the way we face our day-to-day work lives.\n\nI’m proud to say that most of us had positioned in the high positivity and productivity quadrant. However, let’s be honest, we are human, and any team have their ups and downs. This dynamic session was one of my favourites and my teammates too!\n\nI’m curious … What quadrant are you or your team in?\n\nWe are all coaches of each other\n\nI must admit… it’s not as easy as it might look. Why? Because acting like a Coach requires the ability to not judge, always ask open questions and never give suggestions or advice. It was pretty hard! Coach Luís gave us a script to help (including using\n\nSMART\n\nactions), but still… HARD! 😀\n\nIt got worse.\n\nConversation alignment\n\n. Typically, these conversations occur in situations of conflict or blockade between peers. Nothing better to train the conversations than a good improvisation. So, we had 3 different scenarios, and the goal is for everyone pass through the\n\nposition of mediator\n\n. I felt like an actress and I nervously laughed because it is very difficult to solve conflicts between different people, with different perspectives without judging or giving suggestions. And possibility of not reaching a consensus was unsettling.\n\nBut at the end, we all laughed, especially when I wasn’t the moderator of the conversation – the person who tries to get everyone in line! As you can see, these are the skills that any future leader needs to develop.\n\nAnd let me add something – these exercises taught us that we all benefit from having these skills. At any point in time, when we see a teammate in distress or in conflict, we can intervene the right way and be the help in need ?\n\nEye opener, Insightful and Engaging\n\nThe training started in October 2019 and ended in March 2020. Woow! I’m proud of my team’s dedication and commitment to this training, and the overall feedback was fantastic!\n\nPersonally, I must confess that this training really opened my horizons and offered greater clarity on some topics that we already knew, but for which we have become more aware.\n\nWe learned strategies on how to deal with problems and challenges that appear in our daily lives. Interestingly, the feedback that I received, is that what we learned in training, has been mostly applied in personal life.\n\nI also learned that we can all act and mediate problems/conflicts. We have that right and duty as a team member. After this beautiful training, today I believe that we are much closer as a team and, ultimately, happier.\n\nFinally, I’m honored to say that we are\n\nindeed\n\na High Performance and High Positivity Team. What about your team?\n\nShare your experience with us!",

    "content": "Sales Cloud: What you need to know about Salesforce cloud-based CRM. What is a CRM, Sales Cloud and how to get the most of it.\n\nIn times of crisis,\n\nas we are living now\n\n, it is critical to find new strategies to get more leads, maintain our Client’s loyalty and increase productivity amongst our team. And as you can see from the title of this post, I believe that a CRM can help tremendously in these challenging times.\n\nIf you are still confused by this buzzy acronym, CRM stands for “Customer Relationship Management”. In essence, it is a software application that manages critical customer data, centralized in a single location. In this type of app, you can view customer info, send emails, track sales progress, and even follow your lead on social media. Cool, huh?\n\nWhat is Salesforce Sales Cloud?\n\nSales Cloud\n\nis a cloud-based CRM from Salesforce. It includes tools for all the mentioned purposes and more: contact management, sales force automation,\n\nsales forecasting\n\n, and productivity. It allows sales teams and executives to manage the sales cycle, prioritize tasks, manage customer relationships, and access meaningful data about your business and competition.\n\nThis system can benefit companies of any size, both\n\nB2C and B2B\n\n. Because Sales Cloud is a\n\nsoftware as a service (SaaS) model\n\n, companies no longer need to deal with what on-premise apps demands, like servers, software issues, and new version upgrades. This allows companies to lower up-front costs, quick setup and deployment, easy upgrades, and still achieve scalability as the business grow.\n\nA solid CRM strategy is crucial to the success of the companies’ competitiveness. With it, companies can shift their focus on to their core business instead of sales and customer relations manual processes. So, let us explore Sales Cloud features that can help you close deals, accelerate productivity, and make insightful decisions — from anywhere.\n\nClose more deals\n\nNo matter the size of a company, industry, or geography, we all share one common goal: have a growing, successful business. That’s why we need to build a structure to help managers and sales reps to do their best job, with the best technology available.\n\nAnd we all know that contact management with spreadsheets can go south in a blink of an eye. These days, the competition is fierce and to be in the right time at the right place; we need to have a web-based account management software that delivers a 360-degree view of our customers, including activity history, customer communications, internal account discussions, and even gaining insights from popular social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn — right within Sales Cloud.\n\nOnce we have a unified and complete view of contacts, it’s time to identify some potential clients. But how can we optimize this process to close more deals? By streamlining sales process with Sales Cloud opportunity management system.\n\nThis pipeline management gives a detailed, complete view of the most important deals — from deal value to competition — so we can make the right moves at the right time. Here we can check sales stage, products, competition, and more.\n\nAnd if you want to make this process even faster, you can create workflows and approvals processes to automate manual tasks like filling out orders or putting together complex proposals. You can also create automatic email alerts for deals over a certain size, auto-assign tasks as a deal moves through the different stages, and more.\n\nAccelerates Productivity\n\nThe last example was a clear demonstration of what Sales Cloud can do for your productivity’s team. But there are many other examples. Let’s dive deeper:\n\nMobile\n\n: Salesforce has made a huge investment in portability. A salesperson should have the autonomy to log calls, respond to leads, track opportunities, and update data from anywhere and at any time, right from their smartphone or tablet!\n\nWorkflow and Approval:\n\nWith a simple drag-and-drop you can build automated business processes. This feature is highly scalable and customizable to complex business demands.\n\nCustomizable dashboards\n\n: Each member of your sales team can have their own dashboards to improve their day-to-day tasks. They can have a highlight of their work and goal while the manager has a unified view of the entire team.\n\nEmail integration\n\n: Sales Cloud can be seamlessly integrated with your favorite email suite. You can sync contacts, events, and tasks between your email and Salesforce. Like so, you can track every email activity from a contact, without manual logging in.\n\nLead Generation:\n\nWeb-to-Lead is the process of using a website form to capture visitor information and store that information as a new lead in Salesforce. They can be part of Campaigns and have auto-response rules.\n\nFiles Sync and Share\n\n: We all want easy and safe access to files, right? Sales Cloud has that too. Not only it’s simple to share and discuss a file, you are able to track and notify your team in real-time every time something is published or updated.\n\nMake insightful decisions\n\nWhen you don’t have a powerful system behind your business, it’s harder to make fast and critical decisions. By easily tracking lead volumes, conversion rates, and every part of your pipeline in real-time, you view all the state of your business, allowing you to make smarter decisions, from anywhere.\n\nAnd say goodbye to “Joe”, from IT, you no longer need him to build reports! Sales Cloud analytics software keeps you updated with customized sales forecasting reports that you can build with ease. Just drag and drop the fields, filters, groupings, and charts that you want, and get an immediate real-time view at a glance. Easy-peasy!\n\nSales Cloud, Service Cloud… What?!\n\nIf you’ve been randomly searching for information about Salesforce products, I’m sure you’ve come across\n\nService Cloud\n\n.\n\nConfused? No worries let me explain: Sales Cloud was built to help salespeople to sell smarter and faster. While the Service Cloud helps companies to run and improve their customer service. It totally depends on your business requirements, which cloud features fit best.\n\nHow to get even more out of Sales Cloud\n\nOk, now that you made the right move towards high-efficiency sales and master the basics of Sales Cloud, we are ready to take the next step. What if you could get even more value from this top-notch system? Let me show you:\n\nEnhanced customization\n\nIt’s obvious that quick and flexible customization to any business is one of the main features that attracts companies to this solution. And there’s much more than meets the eye.\n\nEvery business has their unique needs and requirements. That is why Sales Cloud offers enhanced customization so you can develop fine-tuned apps, profiles, and page layouts perfect for how you do business. You can also build strong permissions and record sharing rules, using Roles and Sharing Rules features to mirror your Company Sales structure and hierarchy. This way you can set up levels of accessibility to records and reports.\n\nOne of the most important features to remember is that almost anything can be adjusted to fit how you do business. From field\n\nto security requirements, everything can\n\nbe tweaked\n\nto your needs. So, take advantage of that! Tailor your Sales Cloud to your company’s needs. Create your own objects, create your own apps! The options\n\nare as limited\n\nas your imagination. ?\n\nAutomate, automate, automate\n\nAutomation is another key reason why companies make the investment in a CRM. As we discussed before, there are many tasks that can be automated. Simple tasks such as contact, and opportunities management will save your sales team a lot of time to do what they do best: sell.\n\nBut we can go even further.\n\nOne great feature of Sales Cloud is creating quotes incredibly fast. By tracking which products are part of your deal, including quantity, standard price, quoted price, and product codes, you can automatically populate a quote with relevant customer data, generate a PDF from an approved template, and email it to customers directly from Salesforce in just a few clicks. Awesome, right?!\n\nThese types of workflow in a sales approval process, will not only save you a lot of time but also give consistency. The accuracy level of your sales documents, such as invoices, sales requests, and discounts will be on par with the company standards as they are reviewed by multiple decision-makers. Ultimately, it will remove a lot of bottlenecks that manual approvals can make, allowing the sales team to focus on new leads.\n\nConnect and Integrate\n\nLet’s assume that you are a manager or a sales rep. It’s 9 am and you sit in front of the computer. Now envision: how many applications do you need to open to do your daily work? Two, four, ten? You probably need to check your commission status, search for new leads, view contact info, all this over email and a prehistoric ERP. You do you imagine how hard to manage all of this? Not only we have dispersed data, we are storing this information in multiple places.\n\nBut let’s face it. We cannot just stop using those applications. The way Salesforce found to facilitate our work was to make Sales Cloud (and almost all Salesforce products) easy to integrate with other systems. By connecting them, you only need access to one system to see the complete picture of your customers.\n\nThis is possible because of\n\nSalesforce Application Program Interfaces\n\n(APIs). They are simple, powerful, and secure. And if you’re looking for something new, you can also find the perfect fit for your sales needs from partner apps. Check out\n\nAppExchange\n\nfor hundreds of apps ready for you to use right out of the box!\n\nWhat is Pardot? Marketing Automation made simple and smarterWe know that businesses aren’t static. They change and evolve according to market demands. Therefore, the system needs to be prepared for those changes. Anytime a sales rep wants to change a workflow or put in new customizations, we don’t want disruption of the system. Rather than developing and test in Production Org, sandboxes are a great solution. This is a safe testing ground, to help you make those much-needed tweaks that allows efficiency and innovation.\n\nA game-changing way of doing business\n\nFrom a sales rep perspective, Sales Cloud helps decrease redundancies, optimize processes, prioritize actions, communicate better, and access information to close more deals. Managers benefit from features that give a unified view of history and status, and tools to design efficiency-boosting workflows and approval processes. And for those in leadership, with the help of dashboards, analysis, and forecasting tools, they will be able to make insightful and fast decisions.\n\nAs you can see, the success of an organization results from all the accumulated decisions made by all parties. The purpose of Sales Cloud is to not only make lives easier but make them work seamlessly together.\n\nPro-tip: The most successful salespeople don’t rely on luck.

    "content": "Last month, I celebrated 3 years working at the Near Partner. In fact, I’ve been in the company for longer than it has formally existed! When I joined the company, it didn’t even have a name but through my conversations with\n\nPedro Veloso\n\n, I found the security, support, and the challenge I was looking for.\n\nI knew what our goals were, the people we wanted to hire and, above all, the company we did not want to be. No doubt that we would be a great software house.\n\nI was super excited with the project and kind of proud to be at the meeting where the official name of our company was chosen. As a recruiter, my job was to find the people who would be my teammates for years to come. What a challenge and a responsibility… But I am one of those people who believes that nothing happens by chance and even when we hire someone, we need a bit of luck (although luck is achieved with a lot of work).\n\nIn less than 1 year, we went from 2 to 7 people. Starting a project from scratch has been one of the most beautiful challenges I have experienced. Today, we are 22 proud Partners 😀\n\nGreat culture requires work\n\nOne of my goals with Pedro was to build a great Culture. From day one, we decided to put work, empathy, mutual help, and kindness to each other in our top priorities. We believe that that is the basis of our culture today.\n\nThere are several reasons that make me have such a confident view of our culture. And I’m not just saying it because it is my opinion, it\n\nis supported\n\nby the feedback I receive frequently. This feedback happens from the moment a  coworker refers a friend or former co-worker to work with us; it happens when candidates who made the recruitment process with us also make referrals; it happens when my coworkers speak genuinely well about the company they work for; it happens when there is flexibility at work and\n\na good balance\n\nbetween personal and professional life; it happens when we have our one-on-one’s and “Pouf Talks”; It happens when I see my team laughing hard at lunch or\n\nPatrícia\n\nfighting with the guys to win in a Ping Pong game. 😀\n\nThese are the moments that make me smile. Why? They are the drivers that make us a happy and productive team. Let me explain a bit better.\n\nFlexibility and Accountability\n\nWe work for clients around the world. They are in different time zones which means that we all have different schedules. That’s why flexibility is so important. Each one of us has the flexibility and responsibility to manage his or her own schedule. If we need, we can\n\nwork remotely\n\n. We all share this feeling of accountability and perception that we are as free as responsible for our time.\n\nTherefore, we don’t have the need to control schedules or even define rules for how, when or where do we work. We believe that everyone makes the best use of their time and if someone needs help, they know they can ask!\n\nThe Emotional Salary\n\nAs time goes by, I believe that work is less and less an exchange of services, meaning the provision of work for a salary.  The so-called “emotional salary” is a major deal-breaker today. Not only because we all look for our leader’s support, but we aim for a balance between personal and professional life.\n\nOne of the major concerns for most leaders (and ours) is to make their employees feel safe and happy in the workplace. It is reasonable because it’s where we all spend most of our time. Therefore, wages are no longer the only factor in deciding to stay or leave an organization.\n\nFortunately, here at Near Partner (and I think I can speak for everyone) we are rich\n\n, indeed\n\n! We have all the elements that\n\nconstitute\n\na great emotional salary: a friendly working environment, a spacious office with natural light, remote work option, fellowship, and more. All these perks allow us to be more productive and happy – both at work and in our personal lives!\n\nValues based on Company Culture\n\nA couple of years ago, when we\n\ndecided to\n\nimprove the way we communicate, we were\n\nkind of\n\nforced to write\n\ndown\n\nwhat we are and what we do.\n\nAt that time, many\n\nquestions were raised.\n\nWho are we? How do we want to present ourselves to the world?\n\nWhat are our values? Who will define these values? What words will we choose to describe these values?\n\nSeveral questions to which we later found answers.\n\nIt made no sense for us to have someone playing the dictator. Pedro never wanted that role for himself so defining our values should be a teamwork with everyone on board! So, in one of our\n\nLeadership for High Performance teams\n\nsessions, we defined our “corporate” values! Together we came up with a set of values ​​that mean a lot to us. It was a super enriching, and dynamic experience and from it came the following magic words:\n\nI could say that this image represents a diamond still to be cut. This is the actual photo of the paper we worked with and it is still on our office wall. What I am most proud is knowing that they are genuine. We all feel and see these values in every single one of us.\n\nMeet the Pouf Talk\n\nThe values ​​session was part of the training program and was, without a doubt, a moment where we created incredible synergies. But we didn’t want to make this a one-time thing. So, we discuss and highlight them every month in our\n\nPouf Talk\n\n.\n\nPouf Talk\n\nis our monthly all-hands meeting. Characterized by informality, these meetings can take place either in the auditorium sitting on the floor or poufs, while eating a\n\ncroissant\n\n; or even sharing a table over dinner while having a few beers.\n\nNo matter where it happens, our focus is to be together and share. Here we talk about projects, we welcome a new colleague, celebrate achievements, and share any other information that is important at the time (as it happened when\n\nCOVID- 19 exploded\n\n– it was our last Pouf Talk at the office and it was where we outlined the plan to stay together in these challenging times).\n\nCommunication above all\n\nWhen I started working at Near Partner, one of the things that surprised me the most was the ease with which our CEO Pedro Veloso communicates. He is very direct yet informal and fun. He is always available to listen and enjoys a good speech.\n\nFor him, communication is the basis of any successful team. Although he leads by example, he also takes the time to share pieces of wisdom. Some time ago he sent us an email with the disclaimer “You’ll need 15 minutes to read this. So, make the time :)”\n\nHe started by saying that “efficient time management is an issue that matters to me. It turns out that communication is one of the most time-consuming topics. Efficient management of how we communicate is a key issue for us to be efficient in the way we interact with each other, how we pass information and how we share knowledge.” This email was the trigger for an amazing article we shared on our blog. There, Pedro talked about the\n\ntwo types of communication – synchronous or asynchronous\n\n. Go check it out!\n\nEngage and Grow\n\nAnother form of communication that is important to us is the\n\nOne-on-one’s\n\n. We call them “O3” and they are the backbone of our culture. This is a 30-minute meeting between two team members where they talk about everything but work. The aim is to communicate in an individualized way. It is a safe space where we go through deeper conversations and get to know each other better. This is also where we explore those difficult conversations when problems arise… we are human after all!\n\nLast and not least, we have our dear Miss Marple – an app to share and getting to know the people we work with. Developed by our OutSystems team, the app doesn’t allow anonymous responses however, there is no obligation to answer.\n\nMiss Marple sends us three emails per week and the questions vary depending on the topic:\n\nWhat’s up question – Monday\n\nPersonal question – Friday\n\nCompany question – Wednesday\n\nLet me say that this is an incredible way to get to know our teammates. Some questions are profound, others are silly, but they often show a side of us that other people don’t know. And that is wonderful!\n\nAh, and the name ‘Miss Marple’ is based on the character from Agatha Christie, a curious lady, and an amateur detective of police stories. Very much appropriate!\n\nSumming up\n\nThese culture drivers I have listed are our drivers and it doesn’t mean that they are ideal for other companies. What works for us may not work for other organizations.\n\nBut culture is us –\n\npeople\n\n– and that’s why it is so important to choose carefully who is part of our team. Therefore, we ensure that our hiring process is as focused on hard skills as it is on soft skills. If Culture is people, we must ensure that they are a perfect fit with what we want to cultivate in the Near Partner, otherwise our efforts will be in vain.\n\nAnd when we engaged the entire team in determining the company values, we knew we had done a great job in building our team. We were so in tune that it still gives me goosebumps!\n\nAt the end of the day, we are Near Partner’s Culture and the happiness of our team is the best payback we can receive.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this matter?\n\nShare your experience with us!",

    "content": "Last week I came across a tweet that made me think… Did someone just recap the status of digital transformation with a meme? I guess so.\n\nDigital transformation is a buzzword that has been around for years but considering the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, the concept has gained new magnitude.\n\nIf we delve into the\n\nconcept of digital transformation\n\n, we’ll see that it is fundamentally change, especially on how companies operate and deliver value to customers.\n\nWe don’t need to be a rocket scientist to realize that companies haven’t had a choice but to change. Organizations that planned their digital strategy in stages of years, now need to scale up their initiatives in a matter of days or weeks. And let’s not forget about all those companies that lived completely offline and had to adjust their entire reality to the current guidelines.\n\nIt is painful work.\n\nFrom the way we work, to the way we buy products and services, everything went digital–overnight! If the pace of the innovation pre-coronavirus was already fast, the luxury of time now seems to have completely disappeared.\n\nThat’s why this crisis is quickly reshaping the “what” and “how” of digital transformation agendas. And in my opinion, for the better! So, I have identified three areas where transformation is playing out a big role across organizations:\n\n1. Enablement of workforce\n\nThe ‘work from home’ and other lockdown measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has completely changed the way employees collaborate and work together. I dare to say that this is the first significant step towards real transformation.\n\nFor many companies, this is the first time where teams are having to collaborate, operate and communicate virtually through the power of technology. Organizations had to rely more than ever on technology to enable work to happen seamlessly with employees dispersed. As teams move their meetings to conference calls, their workspace to a project management framework and their processes to digital workflows, many are realizing the enormous benefit in efficiency, convenience and transparency that results of digital innovation.\n\nHere at Near Partner, remote work is what we do. As a software-house and an outsourcing partner for companies around the world, part of our daily work is to collaborate remotely with multiple teams globally.  That way we already had many tools that allowed us to smoothly\n\nshift our work to home\n\n. We are pleased to say that our customer did not feel any impact.\n\nSo, what tools did we use to accommodate this change? In today’s digital world, we all use similar technology. There is no secret sauce here! You need to create a digital toolbox that facilitates communication, scheduling, project management, file sharing and storage to drive success. Our team mostly uses Microsoft Teams for all our internal necessities. However, many times our clients or other third parties use other tools. So, it’s common to find our teams seamlessly changing throughout the day from Zoom, to Slack, Trello, and other tools.\n\n2. Transforming customer experience\n\nTraditional businesses across all sectors—from healthcare to retail—have been forced to drastically reduce in-person customer interactions. Consequently, COVID-19 has fast-tracked the shift from face-to-face interactions towards omnichannel digital communications. It is no coincidence that Adobe has registered a 33% increase in demand for its e-commerce products since the beginning of the outbreak. Plus, online shopping during COVID-19 has exceeded 2019 holiday season levels, by far!\n\nAll the organizations that want to remain competitive, and ultimately survive this crisis, had to develop user-friendly, contactless experiences and processes for customers to mitigate the risk of losing them for alternative, more convenient services.\n\nFor example, an airline that in normal times had a team of 10/15 people in customer care to process requests for returns. With the lockdown and all planes in land, this department was overwhelmed with work. To quickly process these requests without losing its client, the airline had two options: hire more people or use technology to streamline the approval process to mitigate human intervention.\n\nPlus, let’s keep in mind that customer expectations for these digital services will extend far beyond the pandemic, and organizations that fail to shift to digital or cease supporting digital processes post-COVID-19 will ultimately lose.\n\n3. The power of automation and scalability\n\nLike I said before, the pandemic has brought more changes than any other event we have experienced so far. Some organizations have gone through more digital transformations in the past two months than in the past 5 years. IT automation is one of the main technologies that fuel this digital transformation.\n\nYou must remember that no e-commerce solution was designed to serve an entire country that suddenly works from home and makes online purchases at any time of the day. Without automation, even the most considered and prescient architecture would collapse.\n\nAnd it’s not just online shopping that has been able to sustain unprecedented demand thanks to automation. The sudden transition to a 100% work at home productivity model for most companies worldwide, has generated unpredictable loads on telecommunications links, video conferencing systems, cloud storage solutions, streaming services, and others.\n\nThe ability to serve simultaneous users not in predetermined times, for example during major holidays such as Christmas, but during every day for the foreseeable future, would be impossible without the scalability that automation allows.\n\nTo meet this demand, organizations turned to robotic process automation (RPA). Robotic process automation is a software, or a ‘robot’, configured to mimic the actions of a human being, using IT systems to conduct a business process. Robots interpret and trigger responses with other systems to perform a wide variety of repetitive tasks. RPA automates repetitive and time-consuming tasks that overwhelm knowledge workers and improve the efficiency and reliability of job results.\n\nIn times of crisis, when you need to suddenly scale your processes to an unprecedented level, this is the only sustainable path. This technology has ceased to be the future of business process management and has become central to digital transformations in all sectors today.\n\nB.C. and A.C.: a new era\n\nNope, I’m not talking about Gregorian calendar. But it is indeed a dating system because there will be a before and after coronavirus.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is irreversibly shaping consumer values, habits, consumption patterns and spending behaviors. We will get used to working from home, all-digital communication will be as important as face-to-face interactions and building a direct relationship with customers will be forever a priority but now with less up-close opportunities.\n\nMany companies are speeding up their approach to automation in the midst of this crisis. They are in survival mode and it is understandable. However, this should not be just a quick fix solution. The investment you make now will increase your productivity and innovation well after the pandemic. Automation is now essential for business continuity and will continue to be an essential technology for all organizations soon after the crisis is over.\n\nAnd remember… When innovation succeeds, the customer wins. Everyone wins.\n\nTherefore, if your organization has limited experience in automating IT processes, the help of the software development outsourcing partner such as Near Partner will be invaluable.

    "content": "Remember those texts and emails you receive frequently from your favorite brands? Those little reminders of promotions and discounts or even just a wish of happy birthday? It is highly probable that it has a system like Salesforce Marketing Cloud behind it.\n\nTechnically, Marketing Cloud is a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) – but for Marketers. It is a platform that delivers relevant, personalized journeys across multiple channels and devices. It enables marketers to deliver the right message at the right time throughout all phases of the relationship with costumers. Marketing Cloud includes integrated solutions for customer journey management, email, mobile, social, web personalization, advertising, content creation and management, and data analysis.\n\nBack in the day, all these marketing activities took place on several platforms, using many add-ons and plug-ins to measure and analyze performance. What Salesforce Marketing Cloud did was brought planning, publishing and analysis together in one place. Plus, all of these activities can be connected to Salesforce, so that marketing efforts can be aided by\n\nSales Cloud\n\ndata and vice versa. Can you imagine how much time you will save on a daily basis?\n\nHow exactly Marketing Cloud help companies?\n\nAs I described earlier, companies gain a lot of time and efficiency. Marketing teams can focus on communicating meaningful messages and stop jumping from application to application. And… all of this is completely measurable! You can view and analyze the performance of your marketing efforts all in one place. Cool, huh?!\n\nBut, in my opinion, Marketing Cloud stands out for helping companies make each customer feel special and unique. As a customer, we all want to feel that brands are talking to us and not to us, plus everyone else.\n\nBut, let’s face it, when you have a business with hundreds, thousands or millions of customers, it isn’t easy to build that 1-to-1 relationship we all love… Unless you have the right technology behind it.\n\nWith Marketing Cloud, we cover every imaginable customer interaction. It unites customer data with customer behaviors in real-time to create more intelligent communications and interactions that anticipate customer needs.  What more can we want and need?!\n\nWhen companies engage with their customers with the right message at the right time and on the right channel, they create a deeper, meaningful, and loyal relationship.\n\nWhat is the difference between Marketing Cloud and Pardot?\n\nThe major distinction between the two platforms is that Salesforce Marketing Cloud is designed to serve B2C businesses, while Pardot performs best in a B2B environment.\n\nHowever, they do not compete, in many cases organizations use both. Every company should analyze their sales process and test which option is best for their business.\n\nNot familiar with Pardot?\n\nCheck this article to know all about this amazing B2B Marketing Automation Software.\n\nWhat is Pardot? Marketing Automation made simple and smarter\n\nAll in one: studios, builders, and other amazing tools\n\nAs we discussed before, Marketing Cloud includes integrated solutions for many marketing activities. We like to call it an integrated marketing hub. Most of these tools are drag & drop and a point & click interface, making it super easy to create sophisticated digital marketing campaigns.\n\nSalesforce Marketing Cloud has many tools, but we will highlight the 7 studios and builders that will revolutionize the way you communicate with your audiences. Let’s go over each one:\n\nJourney Builder\n\nJourney Builder is Marketing Cloud’s visual mapping solution, where marketers can coordinate many marketing actions of different studios on customer journeys. With Salesforce Marketing Cloud Journey Builder, you can bring together multiple ways of communications, such as emails, SMS, and advertising, all into one platform. Building them in a single, holistic, multi-channel journey.\n\nThe fun part is that you can trigger these communications to leads based on specific dates and durations, the information you have about the lead, and how they engage with previous communications. The possibilities are almost endless.\n\nAccording to\n\nSalesforce’s State of Marketing report\n\n, 73% of high-performing marketers say that journeys positively increase customer engagement. That’s because this builder is critical to help marketing teams to communicate the right message, at the right time, on the right channel, based on their behavior. This helps to better understand how customers navigate across touchpoints and anticipate how they may react in different scenarios. Powerful, huh?!\n\nAudience Builder\n\nThe significant advantage of using this kind of software is that you not only communicate with your audience, but you are also collecting a bunch of data. The Salesforce ecosystem is particularly effective to combine multiple sources to help your marketing teams build strong and complete customer profiles.\n\nThe audience builder captures, unifies, and activates your data to strengthen consumer relationships across every touchpoint with a powerful data management platform.\n\nEmail Studio\n\nEmail Studio is one of the most important tools for a marketer. For those who think email marketing is dead, pay attention: the average expected\n\nROI is $42 for every $1\n\nyou spend on email marketing.\n\nDid I get your attention? Good! So, let me explain the wonders that Email Studio can do for your business.\n\nIf your company doesn’t invest in email marketing and you are kind of lost on where to start, this tool will help you. With Marketing Cloud’s Email Studio, you can build emails with no technical expertise through simple drag-and-drop content blocks and segmentation tools to enhance your subscriber list.\n\nIf you are already an Email Marketing Pro, take a step forward and start creating smarter email campaigns, with data from all departments. Go after those customers who only use small devices and communicate in a hyper personalized way based on the interactions they have with your company. And you can increase email conversions with AI by using\n\nSalesforce’s Einstein Engagement Scoring\n\nto predict which segments are most likely to engage with your content.\n\nThank me later! ?\n\nMobile Studio\n\nMarketing Cloud gives companies a competitive edge in their mobile marketing strategy. From this studio you can send personalized SMS messages, push notifications, and group messages to their smartphones. Did you know that SMS marketing can provide customers with timely and location-sensitive, personalized information in seconds? Plus,\n\nSMS text messages have a 98% open rate!\n\nWe know that an effective marketing strategy should target multiple channels, like email, social and web. But mobile marketing gives you something extra — the ability to deliver time-sensitive messages right to the devices customers use most – 2.7 billion people own a smartphone to be exact (according to\n\nStatista.com\n\n).\n\nSocial Studio\n\nMaintaining a relationship with your customers beyond your app and website is crucial. Social Studio helps you quickly create, publish, share, schedule, and boost new content within seconds using drag-and-drop tools.\n\nThis casual communication will help you engage with your customer and get a complete picture of him so that their needs can be met with relevant content and timely customer service.\n\nBut the best return on the investment of Social Media is Data. You need to listen. This feature allows you to listen to what your customers are saying about your brand, market, products, and competitors. You’ll not miss another mention, a conversation, or any question that your audience has. You’ll get a real-time monitoring and a big picture view of what is happening!\n\n#Pro-Tip: If you want to save time or just don’t have any editor software, Social Studio has a built-in photo editor to customize images for your campaigns. And it is mobile friendly, which allows you to perform as timely as social marketing needs to be!\n\nAdvertising Studio\n\nAdvertising Studio is an integrated solution to build targeted one-to-one advertising campaigns for personalized customer experiences. This studio uses first-party data available in Marketing Cloud,\n\nSales Cloud\n\n, and Service Cloud to help shape and guide advertising. It collects customer data from mobile push interactions, site conversions, and email to sync with the contact’s Facebook and Twitter accounts securely. Isn’t it cool?!\n\nThis tool has three key features that make all this possible: Advertising Audiences, Journey Builder Advertising, and Lead Capture.\n\nAdvertising Audiences:\n\nWe all understand the importance of profiling and segmentation. With this feature you’ll be able to create lookalike audiences between platforms (Facebook, Google, Twitter, YouTube, Google Ads, etc.) and identify audience segments within your email and mobile contacts data.\n\nJourney Builder Advertising:\n\nWith this feature, you can build cross-channel journeys that combine email, mobile, and Facebook advertising, from a single place.\n\nLead Capture\n\n: It maximizes your social channel by connecting Marketing Cloud with your Facebook advertising leads in real-time.\n\nBut the magic sauce is once again… [insert drum roll here] DATA!\n\nBy listening and collect all data from these various channels, you’ll be able to efficiently target the right people, and generate fresh leads with engaging content and offers.\n\nInteraction Studio\n\nOk, let’s talk about data… again. Please don’t stop reading this article because you’ll see how customer information is so valuable.\n\nHere is where you visualize, track, and manage customer experiences with real-time interaction management. And real-time is the keyword here. Why? Because by driving valuable engagement at the right moment, just the way your audience prefers, it exponentially increases your power of inspiration and influence.\n\nAnother vital keyword and a common theme throughout Salesforce strategy approach is personalization.  With all the data you collect from other Salesforce products and Marketing Cloud Studios and builders, you can use Interaction Studio to micro-manage the customer journey, by allowing you to drill-down into each customer touchpoint to provide an experience that benefits their specific needs and desires.\n\nI can’t stress it enough that to grow your business and increase your audience’s loyalty, you need to be proactive and anticipate your customers’ needs and offer them the best content.\n\nClose de gap and up your game\n\nAfter this long text and so many words (thanks and congratulations for making it so far!) something was left unsaid, and that it’s super important to remember: this powerful hub helps to close the gap between the marketing and sales teams. Marketing Cloud plays an important role in creating bridges with other departments, but mainly in sales. Besides collect information from first and third-party platforms, it also provides crucial data for the sales team to close more deals, faster.\n\nFrom this blog post, I hope you have got a comprehensive understanding of the Salesforce Marketing Cloud is and its potential. If you are looking to innovate and grow your marketing strategy, this is definitely the way to go.\n\nHere, at Near Partner, we love Salesforce. How does your company engage with your audience?

    "content": "Outsourcing software development has become the new normal, and this strategy has reshaped all IT industry. Gone are the days when outsourcing software development was filled with task-doers and low-cost labour. Currently, it is a crucial tactic for any organisation who wants to keep up or keep ahead in technology. The focus has shifted from traditional work transfer to upfront transformation and innovation.\n\nFrom startups to mega-corps, any company of any size or business complexity can benefit from this approach. Reduce fixed costs, speed up/scale the development team and find skilled developers fast, usually, are the reasons why businesses embrace this strategy.\n\nBut… most of us have heard quite a few outsourcing disastrous stories. However, when it’s done right, outsourcing can be the solution for many of your problems.\n\nChoosing the right outsourcing partner is vital\n\nStarting to outsource your software development is a major decision and for those who are rookies in these complex waters, it may sound harder than it is. The first big step is to\n\nchoose the right outsourcing partner\n\n. In a nutshell, the fundamental areas you should look into are technical expertise and technical fit, skills to facilitate collaboration, and a development mindset that is aligned with yours.\n\nOk… now what?\n\nFrom our experience, there are 4 key steps that you should follow to succeed in this outsourcing journey: a simple contract, engagement, a good onboarding, and well-defined goals and expectations. Let’s dissect them:\n\n#1 Set a contract but keep it simple\n\nA good contract is imperative for any outsourcing relationship. This is an unquestionable statement. But from our experience, there are two views on how important this piece of paper is. We call them “specification-based contract” and “relationship-based contract”.\n\nThe first believes that the contract is the foundation of the partnership. It should have an extensive specification of rights, duties, and responsibilities as well as the goals, policies, and strategies for the underlying arrangement. This approach believes that the contract drives the success.\n\nIn our opinion, this ignores one fundamental condition: change. The dynamic nature of IT demands flexibility. When you have such a strict way of working you compromise the potential result. You are conditioning the way your problem is being approached and limiting the developers work.\n\nThe second believes in the relationship itself. The contract has its place but it isn’t the basis of the agreement. This approach is focused on cooperation, common interests, and earning trust over time. The contract just provides a legal ‘safety net’.\n\nThis is the type of contract we believe in. We stand for a simple and straight to the point document, with pricing models and SLAs that anticipate and accommodate change. Rather than focus on the contract, we focus first on the business relationship, second the economic deal, and lastly on the contract itself – that should be reviewed and refreshed as business and technology dictate.\n\nSumming up, a successful outsourcing partnership requires a well-constructed and dynamic contract that anticipates change.  Additionally, it’s important to have an experienced team, capable of managing the contract and ensure that both parties have the means to exchange views, share information, ideas, and goals. Only through these “agile” contracts and a trustworthy relationships, you can achieve long-term success in IT Outsourcing.\n\n#2 Engagement leads to commitment\n\nA good interaction between the client and the provider will be the basis of a long-term successful partnership. So, take time to get to know the people you are working with. It is important to put faces to names and get to know what makes them tick.\n\nWe can all agree that face-to-face communication still is the easiest and quickest way to get the message across. So, both parties should make an effort to fly out and meet the people they will work with, especially if the goal is to build a long-term project. If it isn’t possible to meet in person, organise a virtual office tour via a Skype video call, for example.\n\nTechnically, it’s a great idea to walk them through the reason why you have chosen certain technologies and frameworks for this project. This can save a lot of time for you and your outsourcing team, when it is time to find solutions to problems.\n\nMaintaining a high level of morale is only possible when you have a great connection. Both outsourced and internal teams must feel valued and respected because this will motivate them to do their best work. Engagement leads to commitment and you need them to commit with your aims and goals. Keep that in mind!\n\n#3 Take good care of your outsourced teams\n\nOnce you take the time to get to know the team you will partner with, the work isn’t over. You still need to make sure they are invested in the project’s success, involved in the way you do things and aligned with what you expect from them.\n\nSet aside some time for onboarding, just like you would do to a traditional employee. The work that your outsourced team will do, will impact your business. So, create an onboarding strategy focused on presenting your company’s structure, the contact person, and all decision makers.\n\n#4 Lay down expectations\n\nUnderstanding the context of what your outsourced team will work on is crucial.  So, make sure you are covering basic stuff such as the project’s purpose, history, priorities, and goals. It’s easier for them to understand the “why” behind your project and what expectations you have with it.\n\nBesides the basic information (that many times is forgotten), laying down expectations of the roles they are fulfilling is vital. In practice, this includes detailing info like working hours, the flow/schedule of a typical day, milestones, and parameters of the project, and how the project will be monitored.\n\nService level agreements\n\n(SLAs) are great examples. A well-designed SLA adds another layer of expectations to both sides and provides goals to accurately measure goal performance. Keep in mind that SLAs must be aligned with technology and business goals. A misalignment can have a huge impact on your project.\n\nIt all boils down to trust and communication\n\nThese steps I mentioned before are key to any partnership. However, they are useless if you don’t have trust. Although trust is hard to define, and it varies from context to context, this is another step to add to your outsourcing journey. Define what trust means to you and find common ground with your partner. This will be the basis of your relationship.\n\nBuilding the foundation of trust is vital, but what will keep it is good communication.\n\nAs a businessperson, you already understand that\n\ncommunication is of paramount importance in any working relationship\n\n. With outsourcing teams, especially remote, it can reach a whole new level.  So, agree up front on how, why, and when to communicate. If needed, as the relationship matures, adjust it. Keep the lines of communication open and be as clear and transparent as possible.\n\nAnd keep in mind – this is a process. It takes time to build trust. But, if you aim for a long-term outsourcing partnership, this is the way to go.\n\nRemember…\n\nEffective communication motivates trust, and trust motivates commitment.\n\nCommitted teams leads to productive and enthusiastic teams!\n\nAre you looking for an outsourcing partner?

    "content": "Choosing a software development outsourcing partner isn’t an easy task even though your Google searches have millions of results. The truth is the market is flooded with options and cracking which company best fits our needs is easier said than done.\n\nWe believe that a good fit between the contractor and the provider is the cornerstone for a good partnership. But how can we know which outsourcing partner is right for us?\n\nWe have figured out the main areas you should look into when selecting your software development partner. In our opinion, it’s important to search both for technical expertise and technical fit with your requirements; you should look for skills to facilitate collaboration; and you should make sure you find someone with a development mindset that is aligned with yours.\n\nWe don’t have a magical recipe, but we do know what questions you should ask to narrow your options and select the software partner with whom you can develop a long-term and reliable relationship.\n\nSo, here it is! Five key questions you should ask when you are searching for a software development outsourcing partner:\n\n#1 What projects have you been working on lately?\n\nAsk for their portfolio to better understand the scope and complexity of their projects and how they have contributed to business challenges and technical problems.\n\nSimultaneously, you’ll have a better knowledge of what technologies and methodologies they are used to work with. It’s not necessary that the projects are exactly as yours, or that the technologies are exactly the same, but you will get a sense if they will be ready to help you with the challenges you have.\n\n#2 How do you deal with communication?\n\nCommunication is of paramount importance for the success of any project\n\n. Developing software without clear communication can lead to misunderstandings on project requirements and deliverables.\n\nSo, look for key elements such as language proficiency and cultural similarities. And don’t compromise in none of them. It’s important to understand each other, but it’s even more relevant to understand the “why” behind expectations, guidelines, and standards.\n\nBe sure to know what channels they use for daily communications and how they dealt with communication problems in the past.\n\nIn the end, don’t expect the ongoing communication during the project to be better than the one you experienced during the negotiation. If it does not feel like it’s working right now it probably will not work going forward. It’s better to learn it sooner rather than later.\n\n#3 How do you describe your company culture?\n\nWe can learn a lot about a company by the way they operate on a day-to-day basis. These are the people who you’ll work with and share the responsibility of your business. So, look for healthy hiring, training, and retention practices!\n\nLook for companies that you can relate to. Look for people who share your values. You should trust them to help you solve your problems, but you should also be able to trust them when things don’t go as planned. When you’re aligned, it’s easier to get more out of outsourcing and overcome any obstacle.\n\n#4 What development methodology do you usually use?\n\nGoals without a plan are just a wish. Software development without a method is just a mess! Look for companies that have structured processes and development stages. Yet, flexibility is fundamental.\n\nFind a company that can adapt to your “way of doing things”, but can still be bold to recommend you new ways to enhance the productivity. Methodologies like\n\nAgile\n\n, Kaban, and Scrum can significantly improve your efficiency. If you don’t work with these methodologies yet, be open!\n\nOutsourcing partners\n\ncan speed up changes within those organizations that have the audacity and skills to leap over the technology chasm.\n\n#5 Are you open for an MVP?\n\nAll the tough questions are done. Now you want to know if you can work together. A great way to assess if both parties are aligned is to start small. Maybe you can begin your project with an\n\nMVP (minimum viable product)\n\n.\n\nBesides being able to quickly bring your product to market and get feedback from real users, you can evaluate how your partner is working. And if anything goes unplanned, you’ll be able to minimize the loss of time and financial resources.\n\nAsk questions but do your homework\n\nPart of this process involves some research work. Check out their website, what they do and how they present themselves. And remember, you can’t expect to find a company that does everything and has experience in everything (that would be a red flag, by the way!). Look for companies hungry to improve and with a\n\nproblem-solving\n\nmindset. That is the type of partner who will make your life easier. And if you have a tech team, involve them in this process.\n\nAnother key element of this decision is obviously costs. But, don’t be tempted by low prices. Quality has its costs, and low prices are usually a shortcut to problems, which typically add to expenses later on. Look for the whole cost and not only for the lowest rates.\n\nFinally, you want to find a partner who you can build a healthy and trustworthy relationship. You should be able to sit down and talk as if you were friends. That’s the type of partnerships we build at Near Partner. And that’s the partnership we think you should aim to.\n\nAre you looking for an outsourcing partner? In your experience, what other questions do you think should be asked?\n\nShare your thoughts with us\n\n.\n\nDownload the free e-Book!\n\nWant to know all about outsourcing software development and how to set up\n\nand maintain a great relationship with your outsourced teams?

    "content": ". Because of that, we tend to talk a lot about the things that happened and what we are currently learning: whether it’s some lesson learned from a difficult project; or a book or article someone just read; or simply an aphorism someone came to as she was walking and thinking introspectively.\n\nAnd all the above happen frequently. We try to\n\nuse our blog\n\nto share the small and simple nuggets we get from those moments. It’s a great way to share them with you – and with the rest of the world. But we come to the conclusion we don’t do that frequently enough.\n\nIt’s common to hear us say:\n\n“That is something very interesting. We should write a blog post about it.”\n\nor\n\n“What a great idea, you should write a post in our blog and share what you just find out”.\n\nThe sad thing is, seldom are those moments transformed into an article.\n\nNot that we don’t put an effort into turning most of the knowledge we touch into blog posts.\n\nPatrícia\n\n, our marketing manager, is the spearhead of a movement to make sure we do it as frequently as possible. But the word “possible” up there is so annoying.\n\nThere are so many reasons that distract us from the goal of transforming knowledge into blog posts.\n\n#We are lazy.\n\nNot don’t-do-anything-all-day type of lazy. But we do have more to do. And thinking about writing a blog post requires putting deep thought into it. Even when the topic is something you already talked about a lot. And had many discussions with many people. It still requires gathering the story behind it.\n\nLet’s be honest, even if the content is very good you need to have a dose of good form for a subject to begin to interest you. There has to be an angle. The angle has to touch you. And searching for that story is hard. It requires thought. It’s sometimes boring. And we are not all that great at writing when it comes to it.\n\n#We have a job to do.\n\nIn the end, writing that spectacular blog post is not our job. Unless you’re Patricia of course. But even then, there are other job chores to do.\n\nLife has an annoying tendency to get in the way.\n\nYes, I want to write a great article about that tool we just used in the project.\n\nYes, we just came into a novel way of solving a type of problem, I’m sure would be a great story.\n\nBut my next project is already here. With deadlines, and scope, and clients, and dailies, and emails, and God-knows-what-else that consumes all the hours and minutes of all the days. How am I supposed to think about anything else?\n\n#We’re not great writers.\n\nAlready said up there, right? So many times we think:\n\n“I’m not all that great at writing after all.\n\nI began the article, I swear I did. But… it was not that good after all. When I began reading what I had previously written, I noticed the topic was not that good. The novelty not that novel. The project not that interesting and the idea not that great.\n\nAfter all, I guess I’m not going to write that article. Maybe next time, the topic will be better. The idea will be fabulous, and I’ll have more time to think about it. And…\n\nSomeone else will do it better than me. So, maybe I’ll just throw something at Patricia and wait for the magic wand to transform the list of bullet points into a\n\nPulitzer\n\nworth article.”\n\nWhen it comes to that, we all need to do a little more effort.\n\nThat’s the point. Sometimes it’s not that good. But most of the times it is better to share it as it is than not sharing it at all. Done is better than that perfect utopia you will never write and that nobody will ever read.\n\nWe have a job to do, but sharing the knowledge is part of that job, too. At least at Near Partner it is. We are better if we know more. We know more if we also learn with others. But more importantly, you learn more, when you must explain to others.\n\nSo, let’s get up from our seats and just begin writing it down. Someone else can always polish it afterwards. As with the\n\nphysical activity\n\nyou always promise yourself you’ll begin next week, just begin. Do half of the utopian marvel you were considering, because half-done is better than none.\n\nAnd you? Are you an avid writer? Or you’re struggling like the rest of us? How often do you write articles?\n\n?\n\nShare your thoughts with us\n\n.",

    "content": "If you’re familiar with Salesforce, it’s highly probable that you have already come across with Pardot. Yes, I know what you thought… what the hell is Pardot? The name says little, but it’s a rather powerful tool.\n\nSalesforce describes Pardot\n\nas a “B2b Marketing Automation software platform that provides a full solution that helps marketers create meaningful connections, generate more pipeline, and empower sales to close more deals.”\n\nPretty cool, huh? But the real question remains: how can we put that into practice?\n\nMarketing Automation – what?\n\nBefore diving in, let’s review what Marketing Automation is. Marketing Automation is a software platform that helps automate marketing and sales process to generate more leads, close more deals, and accurately measure marketing activities.\n\nAnd that is what Pardot can do for your business!\n\nPardot enables organizations to track and measure the effectiveness of their communications, gain insight on user behavior, and personalize content across campaigns based on any number of specific criteria. Pardot is like a “Big Brother” of digital marketing (I’ll explain this later)! ?\n\nClear as mud? Don’t worry… let’s detail the aspects of this marketing automation system and how can it be used with Salesforce.\n\nWhat is Pardot and what processes can I automate?\n\nThe ultimate goal is always to communicate at the right place, right time… right?! How? Here are the main features that helps organizations automate and better communicate with your Leads and Clients:\n\n1. Tracking visits and real-time alerts\n\nWould you like to know and be notified whenever a certain lead visits your site? Yeah, with Pardot this is possible. Plus, you will know which pages he browsed, and how long he stayed on each one of them.\n\nThis is possible because when a user visits the website, he acquires a cookie that allows us to track his behavior. This is why we were calling this feature “Big Brother”… because he’s watching you!  The system sees everything users do on our website, in real time, all the time.\n\nWith this system, over time, you’ll get information about the behavior of your leads to improve your marketing and sales strategy to close more deals.\n\nAnd the best part is, whenever a lead visits a key page, your sales team can act immediately to close the deal.\n\n2. Identifying high quality Leads through Scoring and Grading:\n\nWhen it comes to identifying the very best opportunity deals, Pardot has a secret ingredient: the points and grading system.\n\nThis feature does the job of scoring the main activity, such as whenever they visit a page, fill out a form or participate in an event.\n\nThe grade system is based on the adequacy of the perspective of your product or service – demographic requirements, job description or another qualitative characteristics.\n\nSo, everytime a potential customer makes the perfect fit with your business and does several activities that make him score, it’s time to qualify them and pass the contact on to the sales team.\n\n3. Nurturing prospects and customers:\n\nTraditionally, in marketing and sales, it is often the case that teams waste a lot of time following up and talking to prospects who are not ready to buy. With Pardot, this is how we save a lot of time. The sales team acts only on hot leads and the marketing team stays focused in creating a high quality and targeted content.\n\nAnd let’s not forget about our client. It is an important part of our pipeline. We want to continue to engage with him so he can recommend us to his peers and, whenever he needs another product/service, he will remember that we can help.\n\n4. Make Landing pages your own:\n\nGathering leads isn’t an easy task. Much less when we have an ugly and difficult to use interface. So, it’s important to design and build landing pages that not only reflect your image, but are also user friendly. It’s essential that they are mobile friendly and have small and easy to fill forms that match the value of the content you are offering.\n\nBut, whenever we have high-value content that allows us to better segment the prospect, we need to create longer forms that allow us to retrieve more useful data.\n\nFor these special cases, Pardot offers a noteworthy feature named “\n\nProgressive Profile\n\n”:\n\nThis feature allows you to customize your forms to restrict only a few mandatory fields. After a prospect fills out a form, Pardot remembers that data, and the next time he fills out another one, the fields in which we already have the data no longer appear. Cool, huh?!\n\n5. Plan, execute and launch Email Marketing Campaigns like a pro!\n\nEmail marketing is a crucial component of marketing. As much as the experts talked about the end of email marketing, the numbers shows just the opposite! In fact, according to a\n\nMcKinsey & Co study\n\n, email marketing is still 40 times more effective at reaching your target client than Twitter or Facebook.\n\nPardot offers several features to make you an email marketer! Besides being able to create your own layouts and templates, it has an intuitive and easy-to-use editor. If you don’t have a lot of technical knowledge, no problem. The software comes with several pre-defined templates that can be used.\n\nManaging your lists is easier than ever. Besides accessing all contacts available in other Salesforce applications, Pardot allows you to segment your contacts based on their behavior. This way, you can create smart campaigns that are basically self-managed.\n\n6. Easy-peasy flows with Engagement Studio\n\nPardot offers several automation rules and completion actions that allow you to greatly automate your marketing processes (such as sending email after visiting a page on the website or adding that prospect to a segmentation list after filling out a certain form). But\n\nEngagement Studio\n\nis even better! This is an intuitive marketing automation tool, which is a more complete version of an\n\nemail drip program\n\n. Engagement Studio allows you to send follow-up emails, create a logic-based nutrition campaign and test scenarios to see how a potential customer can navigate the path.\n\nIt looks difficult to use, but it is actually intuitive. Engagement Studio is a way to send emails to a list of potential customers, see how they interact with them and react differently based on how they interact with each email on the drip.\n\nThis is an automated sequence of messages that can change based on the logic you create. This allows organizations to create automated programs that engage the customer at every step of the customer journey.\n\n7. Reporting and ROI:\n\nNone of this makes sense if it isn’t measurable, right? We don’t want to stab in the dark … we want to create, test and measure the success of all marketing actions.\n\nBecause, not only allows us to save money on ineffective actions, it also allow us to frequently adjust our strategy to make more of the resources we have and thus close more deals. With the Pardot, we measure everything that is being produced and, when we look at the sales results and connect the points, we get the true return on investment (ROI).\n\nA bridge between marketing and sales\n\nBesides being a tool designed to synchronize seamlessly with Salesforce, Pardot is the perfect bridge between marketing and Sales.\n\nWith Pardot, the marketing team attracts the potential customer, predicting their sales path and thus directing their communication based on their behavior. This is how Marketing is able to assess how prepared this potential customer is to buy and thus direct all the opportunities with greatest potential to Sales. When a salesperson approaches a potential customer, they already have a handful of information that will help them do more business.\n\nBut this bridge doesn’t end here. Pardot, in alignment with sales, should nurture current customers with content that will grab them even more. Upselling is easier than ever ?\n\nSo, what’s the difference between Pardot and Marketing Cloud?\n\nThat’s not what\n\nMarketing Cloud\n\nis supposed to do? Well, yes and no.\n\nLet me explain. Pardot and Marketing Cloud have a lot in common but are positioned for different sort of audiences. Pardot is positioned for B2B, while Marketing Cloud is more towards B2C. The biggest difference is in the processing and sales cycle: smaller databases with a more complex sales process would better be approached via Pardot and larger databases with less complex sales cycles with Marketing Cloud.\n\nDifferent audiences need different tools to better communicate with each one of them. Pardot is more institutional oriented, while Marketing Cloud focus in 1:1 communication.\n\nAnd they do not compete with each other. In many cases organizations use both. Every company should analyze their sales process and evaluate which option is best for their business.\n\nA smarter way of doing business\n\nYeah… this is what we all want: work smarter, not harder! With Pardot, especially if integrated with\n\nSalesforce CRM\n\n, you can finally unify the cycle from lead generation, to lead nurturing, to closing, and finally to customer delight. But keep in mind that all these capabilities will only work if there is a great effort by the organization to feed this tool! Generate good content, with meaningful messages that will make your client a true ambassador for your business.\n\nWhat about you? Have you ever worked with any marketing automation tool? Hope this article helped you understand what Pardot is. If you still have any question,\n\njust send me a message\n\n.",

    "content": "So… Remote Work. I know what you’re thinking! No commute, pajamas every day and all the time in the world to do laundry.\n\nWork remotely isn’t for everyone, not even for the most hardworking among us. But at some point, we all need to work from home, and it’s in those times we realize that work remotely isn’t as easy as we all might think. Remote work is like working at the boss level: everything is more difficult! Maintaining focus and a healthy work-life balance is a big task.\n\nAs a software-house and an outsourcing partner for companies around the world, part of our daily work is to collaborate remotely with multiple teams globally. Remote work is what we do, and we love it! So, here are a few tips to help you in this journey:\n\n1. Start early and dress up\n\nSounds silly but, when you work from home, you feel like you have all the time in the world. But no. Your day has the same 24 hours as any other person. So, establish a routine as if you were leaving home: get up of bed early and get out of those pajamas! Did you know\n\n61% of women and 53% of men who work remotely don’t get dressed in the morning\n\n?\n\nDespite the idea of being in pajamas sounds satisfying, the truth is that it has a great impact on your productivity: psychologically, getting into “workwear” helps you get into work mode!\n\nA simple step, yet crucial!\n\n2. Find the perfect workspace\n\nAs I said before, a dedicated workspace can make or break (literally) you and your productivity!\n\nBesides that, just like getting dressed, if you don’t separate your workspace from your relax space, your brain will trick you. Basically, your subconscious goes into relaxation mode through association.\n\nAnd now you’re ready to start working!!!\n\nBut, if you don’t have that dedicated workstation at home go out! Libraries, Starbucks or a coworking space could be the solution!\n\n3. Keep a smart schedule\n\nOnce again, the secret is to help trigger the brain and remind him it’s time to work! No matter if you’re an early bird or a night owl, the most important is to set a wake-up time and define a schedule to start working, have lunch, and ending the day.\n\nWe all have that period of time when we are more productive. So, structure your routine around that! Don’t you know when you are most productive yet?\n\nThis app will tell you\n\n.\n\n4. Minimize distractions\n\nWhen you work remotely, you can feel lonely. So, the first instinct is to keep as connected as possible.\n\nAnd this is a good thing… to a certain point!\n\nWe all know that those pinging notifications can seriously impact on our productivity.\n\nIf you are like me, you can’t resist having a sneak peek. Every single time!\n\nMy advice? Turn on the “Do not disturb” mode! This is a wonderful feature that stops notifications, alerts, and calls from making any noise, vibration or lighting up the phone screen when the screen is locked. And better, you can activate exceptions by contact or frequency if you feel the need to stay connected to certain people!\n\nThis feature is available for smartphones and even your laptop\n\n!\n\nEXTRA-TIP:\n\nFor every time you complete a task, reward yourself with a social time! That way you can take that much-needed break and catch up on what’s happening!\n\n5.  Plan your day in advance\n\nIt wasn’t me who said it, was the great Benjamin Franklin:\n\n“By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.”\n\nOne perk of being home is being flexible. But when you have pre-setup to-list you can get more done in less time, instead of figuring out what you’ll do next. Try to schedule the day before, making it feel more official when you wake up the next day to get started on it.\n\nRemote teams need to be motivated\n\nWhen we work as a remote team, communication can be hard. But it’s that communication that helps us maintain focused and motivated. That’s why is so important to keep the\n\ncommunication\n\nlines open and collaborate as much as possible with your team. That’s what we do, here at Near Partner ?\n\nTo help us with this, we have many tools at our disposal. Here at Near Partner, we use\n\nMicrosoft Teams\n\n, but other companies use\n\nSlack\n\n,\n\nGoogle Hangouts\n\n,\n\nHipChat,\n\nand even\n\nWhatsApp\n\n. Choose one and start\n\ncommunicating\n\nnow! Keep a time slot on your calendar to talk to your team. And turn on the camera! We want to see people, facial expressions and emotions. ?\n\nWrapping up. Work remotely with a continuous dialogue helps team collaborate and, at the end of the day, do a better job!\n\nWhat about you? What are the hacks you are using?\n\nSend us some tips!",

    "content": "The coronavirus outbreak is consuming the headlines. It is in our head 24/7 and there is a reason for it. We already know the\n\nimplications of this virus\n\nand how easy is to spread it. For that reason, companies around the world are making bold moves to help\n\nflatten the curve\n\n.\n\nWe are no exception.\n\nHow we are dealing with the outbreak\n\nEarly this month we had our company meeting – Puff Talks – and it overlapped with the first COVID-19 positive patients in Portugal. This was a time of pure uncertainty, and the information about the disease was all over the place. That’s why our CEO,\n\nPedro Veloso\n\n, brought the topic to discussion after a long search for information. He clarified what the virus was and how we can act in order to help to prevent spread the virus.\n\nWe came up with a plan with simple steps that I’ll share with you:\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\n(WHO) preventive measures: hand wash, avoid touching the face, clean and disinfect our space\n\nAvoid physical contact\n\nKeep the doors open so that there is no unnecessary contact with surfaces often touched\n\nTake the computer with us every day in case of need for quarantine\n\nBe conscientious and follow WHO guidelines\n\nThis was an early stage. Simple, but crucial.\n\nHowever, in the middle of this week,\n\nWHO declares the state of Pandemic worldwide\n\n. And that was when we knew it was important to take more drastic measures.\n\nRemote work is the only way out\n\nLast year I wrote an article talking about\n\nhow much I don’t like remote work\n\n. Ironic, isn’t it? But as we all know,\n\nSocial Distancing\n\nis the only way to contain the virus. So that’s what we did. Since March 12, we are all working from home.\n\nRemote work is what we do. As a software-house and an outsourcing partner for companies around the world, part of our daily work is to collaborate remotely with multiple teams globally.\n\nBut we are an office-based team, and we like to share an open-space and work right next to each other. That’s why this is something that we need to work as well! So, we came up with another plan ? Here it is:\n\n1. Provide equipment to work comfortably without putting no one at risk\n\nOur team’s physical and mental well-being is our number one concern. Ensuring that everyone is comfortable and properly equipped to continue doing their work was a worry from the first moment.\n\nTherefore, we decided that whoever needed equipment from our office, such as chairs, monitors, network cables and any other equipment that would help them on this journey, we would\n\nfind a way to\n\nmake them arrive putting no one at risk. The solution was simple: we hired a courier who took all the equipment to the houses of all team members who requested it. 🙂\n\n2. Preserve a social time as if we are at the office\n\nWe have a time slot only for socializing without discussing work. It’s called the Corona Meeting, and it’s 10/15 minutes to just make small talk.\n\n3. Keep our Agile ceremonies\n\nHere at Near Partner,\n\nwe are big believers of Agile\n\nand daily meetings are something that we do on a regular basis. However, this turned out to be of the utmost importance for our work in this circumstance. Every day, at the same time, each team gather and bring everyone up to date. It’s important that each team member briefly describes any “completed” contributions and any obstacles that stand in their way.\n\nThis meeting helps us inspire our remote teams and ultimately improve the individual’s commitment within the team. It creates a self-organized team with positive team atmosphere.\n\n4.\n\nMaintain face-to-face communication\n\nObviously, not in person – digitally! Once we are communicating via Teams, we opt by turn the camera on and see each other. It’s important to maintain some kind of human contact, at least by seeing expressions and emotions (and pyjamas!).\n\n5. Working from home calls for productivity hacks\n\nWe keep a list of hacks to help us focus and be motivated when we are working from home. In these times of social isolation, they are super relevant! That’s why we shared them in our blog  –\n\n5 Productivity Hacks to Work Remotely\n\n. Check it out\n\nThe wellbeing of our Team and Clients are priority\n\nIt isn’t because we are at a difficult moment that we are going to lower our standards. Our customers are used to high efficiency and dedication with their challenges and business goals. All these procedures aim to help our teams to remain inspired and ultimately to maintain the level of productivity that our Clients are familiar with.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, remote work is what we do! Therefore, despite minor adjustments, we are confident that our customer will not feel any impact.\n\nThis is only possible because we fully trust each member of our team. We know that no matter what, they will continue to honor our commitments.\n\nOne for all and all for one\n\nThis is how we are coping with the pandemic. We know that working from home can be a bit of the challenge. But when there’s a contagious illness going around, staying away from packed offices lowers the possibility of transmission. Until the coronavirus is under control, this is what we are going to do. At this moment, the benefits of remote work far outweigh the inconvenience.\n\nAnd we are confident that with our remote teams’ strategy and strong company culture we will be as productive and motivated as ever!\n\nWhat about your company? What measures are you taking to prevent spreading the virus?",

    "content": "Let’s be honest, wherever you look nowadays, you see Agile development all over. Whether it’s a software house, a consultancy firm or big corporate requiring software development they will probably recommend Agile as the way to go when it comes to developing a piece of software.\n\nDon’t get me wrong… I agree with most of the prescriptions, but although we have already heard, read and talked about being Agile, and even if most of us have worked several times in agile environments, sometimes we forget what Agile Development is really about. And usually, that’s when things go South.\n\nThe “so-called Agile Projects”\n\nHere at Near Partner, we are big believers of Agile Development – yes; we are as guilty as all the others for using and abusing the word. And we’ve been around of “so-called Agile Projects” where things were as agile as a 5-ton rock in the ocean’s bottom. Luckily, we are much more used to really agile projects where the Agile mindset is understood and implemented, wich allows us to have a nice sample of examples to learn from. And that kept me thinking:\n\nWhat are the differences?\n\nIs there a correlation between those projects and its success?\n\nDoes Agile Development translate in bigger effectiveness?\n\nI know you are a busy person. I know you probably have better things to do than reading another post about agile development. So, let me cut to the chase and blow immediately the conclusions:\n\nYes, agile projects are more efficient, have better results and relate to a bigger sense of accomplishment from everyone involved;\n\nYes, the end result is usually more aligned with what is needed (even if that not what was defined in the beginning);\n\nYes, there’s a problem with the “so-called agile projects”. So many times, it’s even worse to work in those projects than in others that don’t even pretend to be “agile”.\n\nI will not give you the numbers that confirm these previous 3 conclusions because that’s not the goal of this post. Maybe some other time, I’ll dwell into that. So, for now, you will have to take my word for it. What  I will share with you is what’s a “so-called-agile-project”.\n\nWhat makes them special?\n\nWhat characterizes them?\n\nIn our experience, “so-called agile projects” often miss the essence of true agile practice. They might follow ceremonies but forget that real agility comes from empowering team members to collaborate and adapt. Some rely on buzzwords from well-known agile frameworks like Scrum or Kanban, but lose sight of the underlying agile principle: delivering value early and often.\n\nWhen organizations try to scale agile without adapting to their context, the result can feel heavy and bureaucratic instead of flexible. On the other hand, when development teams adopt a genuine agile approach, they can combine structure with freedom, achieving much more.\n\nWe’ve also seen how powerful continuous improvement can be. The best projects are those where feedback loops never stop and where practices like extreme programming are not just “nice-to-have”, but key to building reliable software.\n\nThat’s the big difference: calling a project agile doesn’t make it agile. It’s the mindset, the practices, and the way teams interact that turn the label into reality.\n\nAnd so, our quest began.\n\nWe are not that special. When it comes to committing the mistakes in the following paragraphs, we’re as guilty as anyone else for having done them in the past.\n\nBeing a self-learning organization, we just try not to commit the same mistake twice (or thrice).\n\nSince the beginning, we’ve been dissecting our projects, whether they were successful or not. One thing we do in every project is running a retrospective of the project. And it was obvious that there were projects where we were not being Agile.\n\nFrom analyzing these different projects one thing became evident. Usually, the “not so agile projects” suffered from at least one of the following problems. We came to call them the 2 misconceptions of Agile Development:\n\nJust set it up, it will solve\n\nAgile is the end\n\nIn order to try to better explain what each of these misconceptions means, we’ll resort to the Agile\n\nManifesto\n\n:\n\nTHE MANIFESTO\n\nWe are uncovering better ways of developing\n\nsoftware by doing it and helping others do it.\n\nThrough this work we have come to value:\n\nIndividuals and interactions\n\nover processes and tools\n\nWorking software\n\nover comprehensive documentation\n\nCustomer collaboration\n\nover contract negotiation\n\nResponding to change\n\nover following a plan\n\nThat is, while there is value in the items on\n\nthe right, we value the items on the left more.\n\nHow do those 2 misconceptions we identified back there relate to the manifesto?\n\n#1 Just set it up, it will solve\n\nMany times, the existence of any agile development seems to be counterproductive. This is particularly true when those involved assume that they don’t need to put an effort anymore. The methodologies are here to make everything right.\n\nAlmost everything in the manifesto contradicts this. Actually, the agile structure, if anything, just bring a “let’s focus on the right things” attitude. People over processes means whatever you do (whoever you are) is important in the project – otherwise, you should not be there in the first place. But the process will not save you from yourself.\n\nIt’s the team’s job to look into such a fallacy.\n\nThere’s no other way. If a problem arises, you (and the rest of the team) have to think yourselves out of the situation.\n\n#2 Agile Development is the end\n\nThat’s plain wrong. Agile is not the end.\n\nBeing efficient is the end.\n\nBuilding the right project is the end.\n\nAvoiding roadblocks, and hurdles, and problems to successfully deliver the project: that’s the end.\n\nMany times, one hears:\n\n“But we should not do that. That’s not what agile prescribes.”\n\nor\n\n“But I once read that in Agile we should not do that.”\n\nor\n\n“My [fill the blank with any father figure in your agile world] once said that was a pitfall we should avoid at all cost if we want to be agile.”\n\nAs to being Agile, the word “Agile” says it all. Things are not “always” or “never”.\n\nProjects change. Situations change. The environment is different.\n\nWe have a brain and we should use it.\n\nSometimes, some ceremonies might not make sense.\n\nSometimes the people involved are not prepared to follow a specific course of action.\n\nSometimes agile may not even be the best option (although most of the time it is).\n\nAgile Development is the means to get you there, not the end.\n\nAs Master Bruce Lee once said: “Be water, my friend.”\n\nWhat Agile development means to you? Do you agree with our point a view? What does your experience tell you?\n\nShare your thoughts with us!",

    "content": "The history behind this blog post is quite peculiar. Let me tell you a little about how I began my journey here at Near Partner.\n\nIt was mid-Jun last year, and I had just accepted a job offer to handle Near Partner’s Digital Marketing. I was super excited! A fantastic opportunity, a wonderful place to work and finally the chance to do what I really love.\n\nA week later the worst happened… Long story short, I went to a wedding party and, wrong place – wrong time, a big heavy piece of machinery fell in my foot.\n\nThe prognosis wasn’t promising and the news I didn’t want to hear eventually arrived in a white scrub: “you have 3 broken bones in your ankle, in four separate places total!”\n\nYou can imagine my despair…\n\nI must admit… my worst fear was a bad reaction from my future employer and team mates. Two days later, at my couch, on a heavy and annoying cast, I called Pedro (our CEO) and gave him the unwelcoming news. While I was expecting the worst, I just heard kindness and understanding.\n\nWhat a relief!\n\nMy job wasn’t at stake, we just needed to find a way to work together.<\n\nAs you can guess by the title of this blog post, remote work was the answer.\n\nAnd so it began my adventure of working from home.\n\nNear Partner’s kind of remoteness\n\nHere at Near Partner we are office-based. We share an open-space and work right next to each other.  Yet, as a software-house and an outsourcing partner for companies around the world, part of our daily work is to collaborate remotely with multiple teams globally.\n\nRemote work is what we do and we love it!\n\nHowever, as\n\nbig believers of Agile\n\n, this could sound a bit counterintuitive. Although we all recognise face-to-face communication is more effective, as the Manifesto says, we value “individuals and Interactions over Process and Tools” – meaning that, if our clients prioritise getting the best people, on a Nearshore approach, we will make it happen… the right way! Therefore, we developed a method to communicate effectively and work efficiently, no matter what the distance, time zone, language, or project complexity.\n\nBut, on our daily routine, we really value being together. And not only at the office. Whenever we join to lunch, talk, or just drink a beer at the end of the week, we try to bring all team together. We leave no soldier behind! ?\n\nIt’s important for us that no one feel left out of any event or decision.\n\nAnd that’s part of our\n\ncompany culture\n\n!\n\nWhy\n\nremote work\n\ndidn’t\n\nwork for me\n\nThe on-boarding was at the office. I introduced myself to dozens of people with crutches and a cast.\n\nNot funny at all but I didn’t go unnoticed! ?\n\nA few days later I started working from home and did it for 7 weeks in a row.\n\nI’ve never worked from home for more than a couple days straight. In the beginning, I was sure it couldn’t be that hard.\n\nA few days into this journey and I started to feel a little anxious and overwhelmed. I know that the health issues didn’t help, but I didn’t know how much I appreciated the office routine.\n\nMy biggest problem was being able to stay focused. I feel that, at home I’ve too many distractions and if I’m not in a great state of mind I get stuck in my thoughts. At home, you don’t have that mate who makes a joke and distracts you from your own head.\n\nJust by going out, get on the train and step into another space – only dedicated to work, my mind gets into a state of\n\ngetting stuff done\n\n(great book, by the way!). I realised that, having a structured routine is crucial and I’m the type of person that benefits from having a well-established schedule.\n\nIf you do not have the self-discipline to organise your own work structure, follow a schedule and avoid the daily temptations of your home, you will have the same problems.\n\nAnother big obstacle was work space. For weeks I got out of bed and went straight to the couch, and it wasn’t long until I felt the pain in my neck and back. Here’s a piece of serious advice – if you don’t invest in a good quality chair and desk, you will eventually pay for it in lost productivity and maybe even medical bills. Be kind to your shoulders, neck, and back! Ergonomics is serious business!\n\nIn a social level, things weren’t getting any better.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn’t have the opportunity to meet and spend time with my team.  I always had that fear of missing out on small things: like something interesting happening in the office, or an informal watercooler chat with someone, or a birthday celebration. Although we have an online chat and we\n\ncommunicate\n\nregularly, I’ve missed that face-to-face interaction.\n\nI need to spend time with my peers.\n\nI need to share experiences and learn something new every day.\n\nI need to be inspired.\n\nAt the end of the day, all these issues ended in an unhappy me. I wasn’t working in my full potential and my productivity was going through the window…\n\nBut, throughout my experience, I learned and realised what habits and behaviours were driving me to this outcome.\n\nIf you are in a similar situation or are considering remote work, check out these\n\n5 Productivity Hacks to Work Remotely:\n\nA final thought\n\nThere are certain advantages and disadvantages of remote work, and like everything else in life, there are people who better or worse adapt to this form of working. In my case, it didn’t go as expected – was much harder than I thought it would be!\n\nBut throughout this experience, I could identify the behaviours that were restraining me, and by rectify them, I could learn how to better manage my day, both professionally and personally.\n\nThe reality is, as remote work is becoming more common, I value much more the time we spend together as a team. Sharing knowledge and experiences are amazing perks when you work with multiple people in the same space.\n\nSo, appreciate it. I certainly do 🙂\n\nWhat about you? Do you enjoy working remotely? And what are your productivity hacks?\n\nLet us know\n\n!",

    "content": "Salesforce Spring ‘19 release is finally here, and we cannot be more thrilled! There are a lot of goodies in this announcement but, for us developers, one just made our eyes sparkle…\n\nThe brand-new\n\nLightning Web Components (LWC)\n\n, a new programming model for Lightning component development, built on top of innovative web technologies.\n\nThis alone can make our whole year. But it was a great pleasure to hear this exciting news in the front row of the 1\n\nst\n\nLisbon Developers Community Meeting\n\n, hosted by Near Partner and presented by one of the most enthusiastic Salesforce developers I know — my team leader and the Community Leader –\n\nNewton\n\nCalvin\n\n.\n\nIf you haven’t had the privilege to attend the\n\nGlobal Developers Week\n\n, don’t despair – help is on the way! We’ve made a short brief with the nuts and bolts of Lightning Web Components. The meeting presentation is also\n\navailable for download\n\nby the end of this post, so check it out.\n\nThat said, let’s get into it!\n\nWhat are web components and why they are important?\n\nFirst things first, let’s look at the technology behind the LWC: Web components.\n\nWeb components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps. Custom components and widgets built on the Web Component standards, will work across modern browsers, and can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML.\n\nThe idea of being able to write reusable and portable code isn’t new but is here to stay and Salesforce knows that! This was the main drive behind these new features. Taking advantage of the benefits of this approach – it’s reusable, maintainable, independent and, most important, provides an encapsulation mechanism – in order to get development in Salesforce easier, faster, and appropriate for any developer.\n\nOk… but what are Lightning Web Components?\n\nAccording to Salesforce, the Lightning Web Components’ technology is a new programming model for building Lightning components, that “leverages the web standards breakthroughs of the last five years, can coexist and inter-operate with the original Aura programming model, and delivers unparalleled performance.”\n\nIn another words, LWC is a set of building blocks of code that gives developers the freedom to use the tools they prefer to build components. Then, by mixing the existing Lightning developer services and low-code tools, we can now use all their existing developer and admin resources to collaboratively build high-performing web experiences. Sounds exciting!\n\nThis is one of the main reasons for this launch but, in my opinion, there are others equally important. Let’s dive deep into them:\n\n➤ JavaScript is the first perpetrator!\n\nLet’s face the fact… JavaScript is one of the core technologies behind the Internet. This programming language is used in 95% of all websites – and, according to\n\n2016 Stack Overflow Developer Survey\n\n, JavaScript is the most commonly used programming language on earth.\n\nJavaScript is used and loved by millions of developers worldwide. LWC just takes the best of this modern programming language and pairs it with the existing portfolio of developer services in the Lightning Platform to help developers work faster, build more efficient and modern apps.\n\nSumming up, now every JavaScript developer can build on Salesforce. Hurrah!\n\n➤ Aura isn’t going anywhere\n\nYou are probably thinking (I did!)… “now I’ve mastered Aura, they came up with this!” But don’t panic… Aura components and Lightning web components can coexist in the same application and it’s important to understand that this model will help us… a lot!\n\nBy creating the Lightning Web Components model, Salesforce aligned their technology with the web standards that didn’t exist or was super hard to build in the original Aura model.\n\nThe most important thing to note is that developers with experience in web components can get in to LWC faster, and developers familiar with Aura will already know most of the major standard components; you just need to translate them from the old syntax to the new. ?\n\n➤ Unit testing with Jest is now a reality\n\nSupport is added for\n\nJest!\n\nNow, you can write unit tests for your client-side logic in a widely proven testing framework. It’s simple to use and as a big support from the community being one of the most used JavaScript testing frameworks out there, including by big name companies like Twitter or Spotify.\n\nJust out of curiosity, did you know that Jest was created by Facebook? ?\n\nWhat about the existing components?\n\nDon’t panic! As I said before, Aura components and Lightning web components can exist in the same application. One doesn’t replace the other. We’ll need both Aura and LWC for certain features.\n\nBut please note that LWC components can be placed in Aura components, but Aura components may not be used in LWC components. So, you’ll see both Aura and LWC components in the same page and communicate with via events.\n\nBy using the LWC you should expect an overall increased performance. It’s true that, in many cases, you won’t be able to use LWC right away, but you can always put them in backlog. Aura will be around for a long time!\n\nSo… should I move completely to LWC?\n\nMy honest answer is: take it easy. We know Salesforce piloted LWC for a year with over 100 ISVs, SIs, and Customers who took part in the pilot spanning over 500 developers, but the real test starts now with the mass adoption of LWC.\n\nSo, if you are halfway through an Aura-based development project, maybe you should stick to it for the time being.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are starting a new and exciting project where you can start playing with these new resources, it might make sense to use some of the new possibilities.\n\nAn exciting step into the future\n\nLightning Web Components is the future of Lightning and the future of development at Salesforce. It’s important to stay committed to make Salesforce development easier and faster.\n\nWith LWC we have better security, better testing, better browser compatibility, better performance, and generally smaller components. This is really good news!\n\nWe couldn’t be more excited to see this exciting step-change in frontend development for Salesforce. And the most exciting part is that this technology is available right now and better… you don’t have to rebuild anything, it integrates with your current codebase 😀\n\nIf you want to know more about the newest Lightning Web Components, please download the Global Developers Week Presentation below! You will find more background details on why and what of lightning web components and all the documentation needed to start playing with these new resources. And don’t forget to explore and conquer the\n\ntrailhead module\n\n!\n\nHave you already started playing with these new resources?

    "content": "The value of Business Intelligence (BI) on today’s market cannot be underestimated. The ability to convert a mess of data into structured and analysable information is extremely important to companies today. Presenting actionable information to help executives, managers and other corporate end users is crucial to help them make informed and educated business decisions. And that’s why custom dashboards play a key role in business applications.\n\nBut can I have a custom dashboard in an OutSystems Application?\n\nYes, you can. And we’ll tell you how we did it! ?\n\nSo, you’ve created your OutSystems application. The application is in production and there is a lot of data being generated and modified. Now… how can we make that data even more valuable?\n\nTo begin with, don’t use a cannon to kill a mosquito\n\nRecently a client of ours asked if we could develop a dashboard with key indicators, according to user’s permissions and their personal preferences. We analysed all the options and came up with two answers: using a third-party BI Software or build the dashboard within the application.\n\n#1 Using a third-party BI Software\n\nThere are multiple BI applications that can take all data and turn it into beautiful, usable reports. But this kind of software is so complex that, in this case, might be a disproportionate solution to our client’s needs. Additionally, those types of solutions would bring extra costs and extra work to integrate with our OutSystems data.\n\n#2 Display indicators and charts within the OutSystems Application\n\nThe second option was to develop a mechanism to display indicators and charts within the OutSystems Application. This was the path we followed but wasn’t challenge free.\n\nAlthough OutSystems provides tools to create dashboards, building the mechanism that allows to display customized dashboards according to the different user roles, requires some development.\n\nSince our application had multiple user roles, with different business’ needs, the first instinct was to develop a dashboard page to each of them. But we needed to know all the user’s conditions prior to development, which we didn’t. In addition, as any growing business, these rules are constantly changing.\n\nThis\n\nstatus quo\n\nwould make the list of requirements super extensive and complex, not to mention the maintenance overhead every time the business rules change.\n\nKeep it simple, keep it user-friendly\n\nAs you can see, there were multiple unknown variables in this project. So, we decided to build a dynamic and customizable dashboard where users can select the charts or indicators they want to see, without any help from IT guys.\n\nOkay. Now I’m sure you’re wondering how we did it. Let’s dive a little deeper.\n\nThis solution was developed in three stages:\n\nThe first step was to\n\ndeveloped the visual elements\n\n– charts and indicators;\n\nThen, since the user roles were previously defined in the application, it was only necessary to map the visual elements to the diverse roles;\n\nFinally, we created the mechanism behind the visual elements’ personalization, according with the user preference.\n\nIn practice, we developed a template (like the image bellow), with fixed spaces that can be filled with widgets. To maintain dashboard consistency, the template has dedicated spaces for certain visual elements. Smaller spaces\n\n1\n\ncould only be occupied with single indicators and bigger ones\n\n2\n\nwith charts of multiple types.\n\nTo change the indicators users must hit the update icon\n\n3\n\n. If they want to reset all data, they just need to click the reset button\n\n4\n\nand the dashboard page will change to default widgets.\n\nLet’s go through an example we’ve created to showcase this solution. As you can see, users can choose which data they want to see with just a few clicks!\n\nBest value for money\n\nThis is how we managed to develop a customizable dashboard. In practice, we had to develop the widgets themselves and a mechanism to enable users to customize the dashboard as they wanted.\n\nIn no way, this can cover for a full-blown BI application, but it fulfilled our client’s needs and requirements. And this is a great solution for many cases out there. As I said before, there is no need to use a cannon to kill a mosquito. We wanted to keep it simple but efficient!\n\nYet, as\n\nproblem-solvers\n\n, we developed a solution ready to grow and evolve. Features like letting the user change the layout template or drag and drop visual elements for easier and faster customization, can be easily added to this application.\n\nAt the end of the day, we are proud to have designed and built a solution that fulfilled not only all the requirements but offered an improved user experience, an overall reduced future maintenance and room for improvement. And that is what excited us the most!\n\nWhat about you? Are you having problems building dashboards in OutSystems?  Can we help you with something?\n\nShare your needs with us.\n\nNEED SOME ADVICE?\n\nGet a free consultation with one of our OutSystems experts.\n\nLeave your email and we’ll get back to you promptly:\n\n﻿\n\n﻿\n\n﻿\n\n﻿",

    "content": "A few days ago, a client called me to talk about a friend of him in need of help. The situation is fairly typical. His company was struggling with software development.\n\nWe began a conversation about the advantages and challenges of using an Outsourcing team for Software development. And, at some point, he told me that his friend had the same misconceptions about Outsourcing that he once had.\n\nThis client of ours was in a privileged position to have such a talk: we have been working together for quite some time now. He had a strong and competent internal IT team. In spite of that, his roadmap had more challenges and opportunities than his team could cope with, so he asked us to help. We ended up creating an autonomous team to develop a specific part of their product.\n\nOur conversation was, obviously, based in the many lessons we learned (and still do) while working together.\n\nHe was telling me that while approaching our relationship, he had several misconceptions about Outsourcing part of the development of his product, but he also told me how that turned out to be. At some point he told me “I wish I had known about this from the beginning. It would have made my life and yours much, much easier.”\n\nSo, let me share with you some of those myths and what we have learned together.\n\nHope, it will make our lives easier going forward! ?\n\n#Outsourcing is for those who don’t have a tech team\n\nAs I already told you, that was not the case for this company we have been working with. They already had a significant tech team, and they had been developing their product for several years. However, their team was falling short of the goals they had set for themselves. Not because they weren’t good, or didn’t know how to do it, but because their goals were demanding.\n\nWe added to their already existing capabilities. Actually, they lagged for a long time because they thought that it did not make sense to outsource part of the development because… “that’s something our team can do”.\n\nOf course, they can. It’s just a matter of when.\n\n#Outsourcing is only an option if you already have the solution for the problem and a perfectly defined backlog\n\nSaid in other words, as the myth goes by “it works if you’re looking for task-doers but not if you need a problem-solver”.\n\nHowever, we have found time and time again, that our\n\nproblem-solving mindset\n\nis one of the most valued skills we can offer our clients.\n\nIn fact, most of the times, our clients pose us questions rather than definitive answers.\n\nMost of the times, they come to us with problems that need help even in defining the right questions to be answered. And that’s part of the job we do together. Not only making sure we are able to develop the “lines of code” but also that those lines of code solve the right problem.\n\n#The other company culture is not so important\n\nWhatever part of your software development or product you want to outsource there’s a “way you do things”. There are expectations, guidelines and standards.\n\nOn our relationship with that client I’ve been telling you about, it was of paramount importance that both our people were eager to learn and improve. The communication was just so much easier – and\n\ncommunication is the key to the success of any project\n\n.\n\nOur mindset and our approach to problems were similar.\n\nBecause of that, even when the roads chosen were not the ones the other part would choose, it was quite easy to explain the rationale of the decisions.\n\nAlso, the fact that we both companies were more worried about adding value than to criticize what the other part was doing, leveraged the realizations we produced together and minimized the problems we encountered along the way.\n\nWhen it comes to choosing an Outsourcing team for Software development, it’s crucial to find a partner that shares the same values. If you’re aligned, it’s easier to get more out of outsourcing and overcome any obstacle.\n\nAnother of our clients told me a few months ago…\n\nWe have been Outsourcing some of our development for a few years now. However, nowadays we almost only work with you guys. It’s so much better to know that you have an absolute commitment to our projects and that we can rely on you to actually make decisions about what you are developing.\n\nBeyond the myths\n\nIf Outsourcing is still a bogeyman to you, just remember: the most important thing is to find a partner with whom you can build ambitious but realistic projects. And it’s also important to find someone prepared to face together the road bumps that will inevitably appear along the way.\n\nWe are proud of the relationships we built (and keep building) and we are amazed whenever we hear things like:\n\n“You deserve a beer”, as one of our clients said. “We were able to get much more done than what we would be able to have done if it was not for your help.”\n\n“Moreover – he continued -, it’s not only what we were able to do it’s how much more we learned than if we would be on our own.”\n\nWe honestly believe it begins with the right fit. It still surprises us to see how far cooperation might take us.\n\nWhat about you? Are you looking to extend your development team?\n\nLet us help!\n\nShare your needs with us\n\n.\n\nDownload the free e-Book!\n\nWant to know all about outsourcing software development and how to set up\n\nand maintain a great relationship with your outsourced teams?

    "content": "The expression “Problem-Solving Approach” has been the talk of the town, where the town is the business world.\n\nWhat is this approach and why is it so popular?\n\nAt Near Partner, we have a lot of fun. We’re not just talking about\n\nrunning marathons together\n\n, having ping pong matches, or just overall\n\nloving our bond as a team\n\n. What connects us all is our love for what we do. But it is not always “fun and games”. We sometimes have stressful, time-sensitive situations to deal with. Situations where our clients have a problem in hands and need it fixed\n\nyesterday\n\n.\n\nAnd, if a client has a problem, that becomes our problem to solve. Time to put on our problem-solving hats and apply our problem-solving approach.\n\nWait… what is a “problem-solving approach”?\n\nAs you have noticed, most recruiters seek “problem solvers”. Almost all career path advisors talk about problem-solving; while some call it a process, others brand it a method, and others name it a problem-solving approach. There are plenty of books, workshops and master classes dedicated problem solving. And it ranks among one of the\n\n5 most requested skills for software engineers\n\n.\n\nIt’s also become a go-to expression, but its meaning is quite vague. For us, problem-solving is an integral part of life. We all do it, every day, in all sorts of environments and situations.\n\nBut\n\n, you might think,\n\nif problem solving is something we all do in our daily lives, at work, at home, and even in our social interactions, isn’t this whole “problem solving approach” just a new buzzword in the business world\n\n? Hm, not exactly.\n\nIn a business context, having a problem-solving approach to complex challenges means using a shared, collaborative, and systematic approach (or method) to solve a problem, following a structure that works for the environment you find yourself in. It delivers quicker and more efficient results and brings many advantages to the business.\n\nThe advantages of adopting a problem-solving approach\n\nDeveloping and implementing a problem-solving approach—adapted to each business, of course—is not just a way to simplify solving problems. It is, in fact, a way to look at problems, and roadmap on how to tackle them. These are the main benefits of having a problem-solving approach for businesses.\n\nProvides a solution\n\n, justifiable, and most likely reliable.\n\nEnsures consistency\n\n. And consistency is key. Businesses that promote consistency in their processes (such as problem solving) ensure that the entire team understands the approach to be used.\n\nIt doesn’t compromise innovation\n\n. Consistency is not the opposite of innovation but rather a complement. If you are sceptical, think about this: how can anyone improve something? That’s right: by knowing exactly what works and what doesn’t.\n\nLeads to greater objectivity\n\n. A problem-solving approach is based on data, not opinions, which eliminates bias. Also, it increases focus on a particular problem which must be solved using a predefined sequence of steps. This minimizes clutter and noise of irrelevant discussions to the problem at hand.\n\nPromotes collaboration\n\nbetween co-workers, teams and management by removing divisions, many of which are also created by bias and preconceptions.\n\nMakes decision-making easier\n\n, because it not only helps teams reach a consensus but also because the solution is backed up by data—that is, facts.\n\nAdopting a problem-solving approach, together with an\n\nAgile mindset\n\n, will get your teams ready to tackle anything.\n\nOur Problem-solving approach\n\nAt Near Partner, we think of ourselves as problem solvers, not task-doers. And this reflects in everything we do, from who we hire to how we recruit, and to how we treat each other in the company. Our metric for success isn’t how many lines of code we write. Not even how many good lines of code we write. Our metric for success is\n\nhow many problems we solve\n\n. It is important to give the perfect answer, but only if we are\n\nanswering the correct question\n\n.\n\nWhenever we need to tackle a problem, we follow a structure that can be divided into six stages:\n\n1.\n\nDescribing and quantifying the problem\n\nWe always start with questions: What seems to be the problem here? What is our client facing? What do they need, and what have they gotten instead? We keep asking until we have identified the problem exactly.\n\n2.\n\nIdentifying the root causes of the problem\n\nAfter the initial questions, we move on to, yes, more questions: Is there a technical limitation? Is the problem architectural? Or is it due to lack of communication with the development team? Is the business analysis correct?\n\n3.\n\nDefining a prototype solution\n\nThe development of our solution to a client’s problem also starts with questions: What can we do about it? Should we throw the application away and redo the whole thing? Should we use some other software development language like .NET, Java or OutSystems?\n\n4.\n\nTesting and evaluating\n\nWhen we get our prototype solution, we test it. Is it working perfectly? If not, let’s circle back and question some more, think some more, and test it again.\n\n5.\n\nStarting rollout\n\nAfter all is done, tested and verified, we start rollout. And this does not only mean setting the network up and getting the software rolling. It also means getting the whole team of our client on board, explaining how to, when to, and where to.\n\n6.\n\nDocumenting (and saving) for future reference\n\nAnd just before we wrap it up, we take away the important bits: what we’d got to work with, what we’ve done, how our solution turned out. Then we keep it for future reference, and only then, we think “mission accomplished”.\n\nAre these six steps carved in stone? Not at all. This is a basic process we follow, but the beauty of it is our problem-solving approach allows us to identify and pursuit opportunities to innovate, and to create alternative paths and ways to solve problems.\n\nSolved problems are our success metric\n\nAt the end of the day, we don’t count how many lines of code we wrote, or how many people worked on a specific project. We count how many problems we solved, how many clients we’ve helped, and how much we’ve learned in doing so.\n\nDo you need help with problem-solving?\n\nTalk to us\n\n!\n\nOur\n\nfantastic team of problem solvers\n\n(and excellent problem finders, too) can help you figure out what is wrong and deliver a solution that is just right for your and your business’ needs.

As a senior developer and team leader, it is very important to share experiences and connect with developers, hoping to bring fresh ideas to the projects I’m involved.\n\nThis is also a good opportunity to start partnerships and trusted relationships with potential customers. Time to get your business cards out!\n\nNetworking, Networking, Networking\n\nWith thousands of people around, the ones you want to talk to won’t just show up and engage with you. You need to make the first move and approach them in an enjoyable and engaging way. Nail down your “Tell me about yourself” answer and prep some non-work questions or ice breakers for networking when you meet someone new. Having trouble deciding how to introduce yourself? Here are some\n\ntips to help you make a great first impression\n\n. Use those tips and rock the NextStep Networking Reception and breaks!\n\nHopefully you will be meeting a great deal of different people, and no matter how hard you try, you cannot remember them all. Add notes on business cards directly after meeting people. Make specific notes. It will help you remember them a few days later, back in the office.\n\nSwag it up!\n\nEvery year I’m thrilled to know what the swag is. I’m anxiously waiting for my\n\nNeo action figure\n\n, but until then I’ll rock with my backpack with a couple of badge pins shared with NextStep attendees. Sounds silly but these are gifts that I keep as a recollection of my journey as an Outsystems developer.\n\nSumming up\n\nNextStep is an event to find inspiration from hearing firsthand how other companies are using Outsystems, connect with thought leaders for cutting-edge perspectives on IT challenges and best practices, and learn about new Outsystems features. Yeah, I’m pretty sure you can’t miss it!\n\nPS., Outsystems 11 release brought a lot of new features and I’m excited to share my thoughts about it. Soon… Stay tuned!",

    "content": "“Great things in business are never done by one person.\n\nThey’re done by a team of people.”\n\nSteve Jobs\n\nWe tend to use this expression a lot on our day to day work. But this weekend it gained a new meaning. Most of our team actually decided to\n\nparticipate in a marathon\n\n– and it was fantastic. While looking back to a wonderful morning – and also resting my legs while at it – I began thinking that there was more about the expression than what we were realizing.\n\nFirst of all, let me clarify something – what does it mean “we run marathons” in the business environment and why do we use it?\n\nMany times, we have conflicting paths and have to choose one:\n\nIt might be whether to hire someone that would be very useful to some project right now but who has a very toxic personality and we think might hurt our team’s cohesion in the long run;\n\nSometimes we have to decide on whether we can take some more clients while we have a fully occupied team – damaging all the projects a little – or we can decline or withhold the opportunity;\n\nIt might be a project that in the short term is very lucrative but that will drain a lot of energy and attention from the team, hindering the success of the other projects we have undergoing;\n\nSometimes we have to decide on whether to enlist someone for a particular course or certification class at the expense of the billing hours that those days would have meant;\n\nWhenever these doubts come up, we fall back to the same mantra:\n\n“We run marathons”\n\nand try to choose the option that will take us nearer to where we want to be. Our option is focusing on the long-term value instead of the immediate gains.\n\nBut today, while hugging the rest of the team at the finish line it came to me that there’s more to it than we were seeing. Today, we realized that the expression has, at least three other meanings:\n\n1. We don’t run alone – and it’s more fun to do it with others\n\nLet’s face it: sometimes it hurts to do a long run. Yes, we enjoy it – hence we participated – but it’s not without its thorns. Although we take ourselves as self-motivated people we all need a push from time to time. For some of us it’s just getting out of bed. For others are the last few miles. Whatever the moment when you lack some stamina, it’s easier when a good friend is there to inspire you and impel you to the finish line.\n\n2. We don’t have to run at the same pace to enjoy it with the others\n\nThere are moments when we don’t all have the same strength. Some of us are natural runners. Others are athletes at some other disciplines. There are a few without much training. Some were not in the best physical shape.\n\nCould we all run at the same stride? Definitely not.\n\nDid we all enjoy the run? Absolutely yes.\n\nThe fittest helped the others. The more vocal motivated the rest of the team. Our internal strength was even inspirational sometimes.\n\nBut we began together, and we gathered at the finish line. We were all exhausted, but we were happy. We all made it.\n\n3. Train makes it more comfortable\n\nThe fact is it was easier for some than for others to get to the finish line. When we got together for lunch afterwards there was a shared conclusion: it’s much easier if you train. We value comfort. We must be comfortable on our shoes and while doing something to be good at it – and actually to be able to enjoy while we’re at it. Training makes you more comfortable. While running, while working and in most walks of life.\n\n“I started a joke…”\n\n…but unlike the song it didn’t start the whole world crying.\n\nOn the contrary, we subscribed for a run and got more than what we were expecting. It all began as a joke, during lunchtime. “Hey, we should all participate on the next long run” – someone said. “We could all use the activity and it might be fun.” Guess what, we were right. A few months later, here we were getting ready for what would be the first long run for most of us!\n\nAs the saying goes:\n\n“If you want to get fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together”\n\nWell, we run marathons so always prefer to go together… Aesop\n\n“In union there is strength.”\n\nAesop",

    "content": "What’s all this fuss around AI (artificial intelligence) and Machine Learning? Everyone has seen a movie where an evil computer tries to conquer the world and subjugate human kind. Well… I’m sorry to disappoint you, but the current AI isn’t that kind of movie material. AI is here. AI is already part of your daily life.\n\nReally? Where?\n\nAI is in your Google search and when it tries to guess what you are searching for. It’s there when you’re buying something, and it suggests products that you might have an interest in (also when you’re watching Netflix, by the way). It is there when your photo album app recognizes the faces of your family members. You can find AI basically in every aspects of your life and across many industries and businesses. Most of the time you don’t even realize that it’s there. The reality is that your life gets pretty easy, giving you more free time to pursue your goals!\n\nBusinesses are already embracing this technology, that was recently released to the masses and out of the scientist’s realm. You might not know it yet, but your competition is probably already seizing this opportunity.\n\nHow impactful can Artificial Intelligence be on the world?\n\nIt‘s estimated that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will make 75 million jobs obsolete by the year 2022, according to a new report from the\n\nWorld Economic Forum\n\n. However, job losses will not outweigh job creation (133 Million jobs). AI will, undoubtedly, represent a huge challenge!\n\nThis represents a big challenge to your business as well. You’ll need to understand which technologies to invest in but, more importantly, you’ll need to realize that, above all, you must invest in people. This is the crucial step. It’s estimated that a large majority of all employees will require significant training. I think an investment in both training and hiring new people will be the best business approach.\n\nWhat is driving this change?\n\nAccording to the\n\nWEF\n\nreport, there are four main causes: i) ubiquitous high-speed mobile internet, ii) the evolution of Artificial Intelligence itself, iii) the widespread adoption of big data analytics, iv) and cloud technology. Most of the surveyed companies will expand their use of big data analytics and likely adopt new technologies such as IoT, cloud computing and machine learning.\n\nThe state of work survey\n\nby Workfront (a source usually used by WEF) is showing that businesses aren’t ready for the\n\nrapid innovation\n\nthat a sustained market leadership will require. Innovation may need better tools and time in order to succeed, because employees will need to feel free to innovate and not be stuck in the day-to-day work.  As you can see below, by 2022 the skills required to perform most jobs will be significantly shifted :\n\nThey also predicted that, in a near future, robots or artificial intelligence will replace a portion of people’s jobs. Initially, it will be centered on “white collar” jobs, such as contact centers, human resources or accounting departments. Robots and machine learning will be a tool that helps workers getting things done and focus on innovation. However, this new era shouldn’t be feared but rather understood as an ally.\n\nThese changes will not happen just because one wants it to. It will need major changes within your organization. For example, in order to entice better innovation, your business should be measuring workers by the success of business initiatives (instead of their predefined role’s). This way, people will be better aligned with the main business focus point.\n\nPRO TIP\n\n[edgtf_blockquote text=”Initially, this can be a scary change. So, start using new technologies or new ways of work in a small test group. Plan, test, adjust and implement!” title_tag=”h4″ width=”85%”]\n\nWhat is Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning?\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n(AI) is basically any intelligence exhibited by a machine which given a problem will lead it to a solution. According to\n\nWikipedia\n\n, Artificial Intelligence “is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals”. Back in the 50’s AI started as a dream to construct a machine that would have the same features as the human intelligence. This is known as General AI and we aren’t there yet.\n\nWhat has been done falls under the realm of the Narrow AI, which is defined as the technologies that can perform a specific task as well or better than a human can.\n\nMachine learning\n\n(ML) is a subset of the larger discipline AI and represents a way to achieve AI. Machine learning is “the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed” (Arthur Samuel, 1959). It is the practice of using\n\nalgorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction\n\n. Therefore, themselves, these algorithms don’t have the solving or cognitive capabilities. These are mainly elements of a whole.\n\nDeep learning\n\nis an approach to ML which is inspired by the architecture of our brains. Therefore, it is the spectrum of algorithms that mimic the workings of a biological brain (Neural Networks). It‘s constructed by different layers of neural networks that focus on a primary characteristic. This layering feature is a reason for the name deep learning.\n\nDoes my business really need AI?\n\nThe “big dogs” already are using Artificial Intelligence. The ones that aren’t, must up their game or fade away… that’s how it rolls! What about small businesses? Do they need AI? Without the necessary financial and technical resources will small business lag?\n\nTechnology adoption will always be slower for small businesses – AI or otherwise. But by not adopting it, there are opportunity costs that, in longer term, may be the difference between a business that sky rockets and a business that doesn’t seem to budge.\n\nWhat AI brings is the ability to work on what matters the most, leaving the repetitive tasks to a computer. This argument alone should be more than enough for a small business where every bit of time is precious.\n\nAI will make a bigger difference for the early adopters, who will be a step ahead of the competition. But how? Marketing and lead generation are areas where AI can make a huge difference. Also, the time spent on customer support or fine-tuning a marketing campaign can be drastically reduced.\n\nFinally, AI will accompany the business growth, meaning that, the cost tends to decrease and deals to increase! Sounds good, doesn´t it?!\n\nWhere are AI and Machine Learning being used?\n\nIn the earlier years, Artificial Intelligencedomain was restricted to a community of researchers and academics. In the past few years, AI application in business has seen an exponential growth. Why? Simply because the learning algorithms are being released to the global community as programming libraries or frameworks (such as Python’s NumPy and Keras or Google’s TensorFlow). The truth is that you don’t need to know how a car works mechanically to know how to drive it!\n\nWhere we find use cases of AI application? In multiple corners of business. So, tune in!\n\nHealthcare:\n\nHealthcare Artificial Intelligence Software, Hardware, and Services Market will surpass $34 Billion Worldwide by 2025. Tractica reported that AI is being progressively used to bettering data analytics capabilities, besides automating key healthcare-related tasks. Also forecasts that global software revenue from 22 key healthcare AI use cases will grow from $511.7 million in 2018 to $8.6 billion annually by 2025. Tractica projects that the top 10 use cases for healthcare AI will be as follows:\n\nMedical image analysis;\n\nDrug discovery and effectiveness;\n\nMedical treatment recommendation;\n\nPatient data processing;\n\nMedical diagnosis assistance;\n\nConverting paperwork into digital data;\n\nAutomated report generation;\n\nHospital patient management system;\n\nBiomarker discovery;\n\nCost reduction.\n\nGovernance and Policy/Legal Compliance:\n\nAI is being used to help analyze effects of a legislation more accurately and helping the government’s day-to-day administration. Stanford University and ETH Zurich researchers came up with an algorithm that\n\nhelp countries settle refugees\n\nby finding employment and integrating into an unfamiliar society. This algorithm works by comparing individual features, such as English fluency and education level, settlement location and the person’s employment outcome. Potentially, employment rates would be boosted by 41%;\n\nAt Stanford University, Stefano Ermon, a computer science professor, is\n\naddressing the poverty issue\n\nwith a “computational sustainability” tactic. Deep learning is being applied to satellite imagery (night and day imagery), to predict poverty in regions where surveys are inaccurate or even impossible. This same approach can be used to estimate economic development (through electrical infrastructure mapping, for example) and identify the locations that need aid the most (by determining the location’s agricultural production or its proximity of water sources). This approach has outperformed the traditional crop predictions;\n\nThe type of cars found in a neighborhood can be a good interpreter for\n\nsocioeconomic status or political inclinations\n\n. Fei Li – a computer vision expert – is using Google Street View data to determine metadata regarding the cars that are found. “if the number of sedans encountered during a 15-minute drive through a city is higher than the number of pickup trucks, the city is likely to vote for a Democrat during the next Presidential election (88% chance); otherwise, it is likely to vote Republican (82%).”\n\nFinance:\n\nCapital One Eno is a chatbot that enables customers to chat with the bank using text-based natural language to pay bills and retrieve account information;\n\nWells Fargo uses AI to prevent fraud and better compliance, customer experience, underwriting and authentication;\n\nIBM Watson is being used for Cybersecurity with multiple players in insurance and banking industries;\n\nWealthfront and WiseBanyan are robot advisors that automate portfolio management services which are used to manage and grow customer investments.\n\nIndustrials/Engineering/Manufacturing\n\n:\n\nSiemens’ Mindsphere is a smart cloud for industry, also integrating IBM’s Watson Analytics. It aims to monitor and analyze everything from design phase to the delivery of manufacturing, in order to find unseen problems and respective solutions. As an example, Siemens latest gas turbines (with more than 500 sensors) feed its monitoring information (the internal fluid’s variables such as temperature, pressure, etc. and other external variables) to its AI, which enables Siemens to continuously adjust the turbine parameters to attain optimal performance;\n\nGE’s Brilliant Manufacturing Suite is taking a holistic approach to also monitor everything in the manufacturing process. It has been mentioned to have improved the effectiveness of machines in a factory by 18 percent;\n\nGenerally, AI is serving manufacturers to find new business models, adjust product quality and enhance manufacturing operations at the shop floor level​. McKinsey has predicted that machine learning will diminish supply chain projection errors by 50% and increase sales through better product availability. ​\n\nArt and Design:\n\nAdobe Sensei’s image-editing features help you to easily change a “frown into a smile” which would normally take you hours to accomplish. Google Brain’s Magenta project aims for generative art and build;\n\nAutodesk’s Dreamcatcher is the CAD system that speeds up industrial product design. Through AI, Dreamcatcher is automatically generating multiple design variations to more rapidly create the final best product as per its requirements;\n\nUIzard Technologies created Pix2Code using computer vision and NLP to convert GUI screenshots into working code, therefore, dramatically abridging the workload of front-end developers.\n\nMarketing / Ecommerce:\n\nTwiggle or Clarifai work in e-commerce search engines, avoiding consumers to abandon their e-commerce experience;\n\nMintigo, a predictive marketing business is enabling the generation of significant new leads (customer prospects) for Getty by capturing the data that shows which businesses have websites featuring images from Getty’s competitors;\n\nThe North Face is using IBM Watson to enable online customer to determine their perfect jacket.\n\nHuman Resources:\n\nStudying the employee’s query patterns\n\nmay improve future interactions and create relevant information for other employees\n\n(for example, while you are typing in chrome browser, Google     is able to suggest alternative queries). A knowledge base can be continuously created by diagnosing the queries from your employees. If you gather the appropriate responses for these queries, you’ll be able to deliver requested information without using a HR representative;\n\nLike Amazon is applying their AI engine to suggest products that you might want, you can apply the same concepts to your HR department. All information (articles, pages, external links, legal forms, etc.) related to a specific HR subject may be made readily available or suggested to the employee at the time of his or hers first inquiry on the company’s intranets.  It would base this information on what other employees searched regarding that same subject;\n\nIBM is\n\nhiring with AI’s help too\n\n. IBM is using AI to obtain each job applicants’ digital trail. This software is able to screen work samples, social media or behavior signs (like understanding, prejudice, curiosity, etc.). As a result, they can better identify the people that best fit the company’s culture.\n\nAnd the list goes on and on…\n\nNow is the time to act\n\nSumming up. Artificial Intelligence is here to stay, and it is everywhere… Ouch! This almost sounds like the big brother entity from famous George Orwell’s book, “1984”. It’s accessible and your competition is probably already making a move.\n\nYour first step of this long walk is done! You read this article to the end. You are now aware. It’s up to you to make this information actionable. There are already plenty of online courses you can learn from, oriented both to business and/or technical facets.\n\nBut don’t stop here! Join a community. Follow the most influential people on social networks. Investigate what is being done on your industry. Join one of our conversations about AI. We are also learning about it, you know? We can make this journey together. So, l\n\net’s connect!\n\nSend us your questions and concerns\n\n!",

    "content": "As a company with a multi-cultural environment, with teammates from all over the country and several other countries, working with different technologies and some with independent teams, often we feel the need to gather and just chat. We talk about the matters that matter [sic], that are more macro about our daily lives.\n\nWhat is a One-on-One for us\n\nA One-on-One is a periodical 30-minute meeting (more or less), usually between a manager and a team member, with the goal of building trust and relationship. This is where we uncover potential issues, share and ask for feedback and connect as a team. It isn’t the place for status updates!\n\nRecently, we gathered to discuss our One-on-One’s (at Near Partner; we call it O3) and we all agree the utmost importance of these meetings. It has been a bastion of our company culture from day 1, a perk. A space for openness, transparency, where everyone feels valued, respected and cared about.\n\nAs a family of diverse opinions, we weighted on what was going just great and what could be improved.\n\nOne thing that struck me, and that I’ve been thinking about almost daily, was that a few people felt the need to have one-on-ones with members of other teams, to build communication with whom they wouldn’t interact much otherwise. In my opinion, this kind of interaction is out of the scope of One-on-One’s. We need and should have moments to build this kind of relationship but there are so many other ways to do it…\n\nmarathons\n\n, for instance! But this is another whole blog post! 😀\n\nAt the end of the day, what kept me thinking was the thrive to build more meaningful relationships. I felt that we all care deeply about each other and that we just want more of it. We want to have time and means to nurture them, in and out of one-on-one’s!\n\nWhy we do it?!\n\nI mentioned this meeting with my wife and several of my non-technology working friends and they were all amazed. In these ultra-technological times, with all the communication abilities that the internet gives us, these\n\ntechie guys\n\nfelt the need to be face-to-face with each other.\n\nAnd this was the main point that make me want to write this post… These connections drive us as persons.\n\nSince we were kids, we behave, talk and dress like our peers, following this need of belonging to the group, be a part of the tribe. That’s why punks have spiky haircuts and the grunge guys wear the flannel shirts – to be part of something, to be part of a community that shares the same values.\n\nWe want to acknowledge and be acknowledged.\n\nAt our core, at the most deep of us [cheesy alert ON] we want to Love and be Loved [cheesy alert OFF] at several levels.\n\nThat’s what drives most of our attitudes and behaviours, what we seek in relationships. We were made to relate, not to be alone. No one can thrive alone.\n\nWe all know that the enterprise office life can be dehumanizing sometimes, focusing in financial objectives and obscure personal goals. It can help build many shallow relationships, where we spend more time with our colleagues than with our families but, at the same time, we feel displaced and not part of anything.\n\nThat’s the importance our one-on-one’s have to us.\n\nIt brings humanity to our office. It helps bring more meaningful relationships. It helps us feel a real part of something, where everyone has a voice, not just once but on a recurring basis.\n\nAnd that’s why we are so happy working here.\n\nWhat about you? Do you have regular one-on-one meetings with your teammates? What is the impact on the culture of your company and day-to-day work? Share your experience with us!",

    "content": "Portugal is a great place for your next vacations. There are millions of reasons, from our amazing weather, the outstanding beaches or the incredible wine. The World Travel Awards just recognized Portugal as the World’s Leading Destination and Lisbon as the World’s Leading City Destination. You definitely can’t beat that…\n\nThese are great reasons to visit and live in Portugal. However, there is so much more than meets the eye!\n\nHome of the\n\nbiggest tech conference in the world\n\nand\n\ntop choice for foreign investors\n\n, nowadays Portugal is called the new\n\nSilicon Valley.\n\nBut, why?\n\nWhat are the key drivers behind these claims? And how do they relate to the exponential growth in outsourcing in IT services?\n\nA couple hundred reasons can be listed, but time is money. Let me highlight 5 great reasons why you should choose Portugal as your outsourcing destination:\n\n1. A global talent hub\n\nHere you’ll find a pool of highly skilled, experienced and driven workforce.\n\nAccording to IMD, Portugal has “skilled labour readily available”. Still according to IMD, the “international experience of senior managers is generally significant”, and “the management education meets the needs of the business community”.\n\nBesides that, the Portuguese language is one of the top 5 most spoken language in the world and we also have high proficiency in English (#5 in the world, according to\n\nIMD\n\n).\n\nPortuguese are great communicators and\n\ncommunication is of paramount importance for the success of a project\n\n.\n\nThis is the current scenario. The trend is to grow even more. Portugal is the 3\n\nrd\n\ncountry that most invests in education per student.\n\nPortugal is ranked in 17\n\nth\n\nat\n\nIMD World Talent Ranking 2018\n\n. comparing favourably with Ireland (21\n\nst\n\n), UK (23\n\ntr\n\n), France (25\n\nth\n\n), Slovenia (30\n\nth\n\n), Spain (31\n\nst\n\n), Poland (38\n\nth\n\n) or Ukraine (48\n\nth\n\n).\n\n.\n\nThis report is based on countries’ performance in three main categories — investment and development, appeal and readiness. The three categories assess how countries perform in a wide range of areas. These include education, apprenticeships, workplace training, language skills, cost of living, quality of life, remuneration and tax rates.\n\nMoreover, if you have a problem, you’ll want a Portuguese at hand. We all have a MacGyver within ourselves! ?\n\n2. Prime location\n\nWe have 8 hours of daily sunshine, 290 rain-free days and 2 600 km of coastline. That alone makes Portugal one of the most appealing places on earth. Apart from that, Portugal co-ranks #1 worldwide in\n\ntrading across borders\n\n, acting as a door to the European market (>500 M people) and Portuguese-speaking countries (>260 M people).\n\nSounds interesting, doesn’t it?\n\nAnd let’s not forget that Portugal is also in the same time zone as London, one of the most important global markets.\n\nOur adaptability to multicultural approaches and international environment is in our blood. For centuries we crossed the seas and engaged with many cultures. You still can find this atmosphere today. Our hospitality, open spirit and openness to work with different cultures is a major plus.\n\n3. Great value to cost ratio\n\nObviously, cost will always be an aspect in mind when outsourcing software development. Saving money is a priority for any business, but other factors must be remembered. Skilled people and an overall political and social stability are key when you are choosing an outsourcing destination.\n\nIf you only care about cost, you can choose the Asian market. However, along the way, you’ll probably find a few bumps the in the road: communication, time zone, social environment, political or economic instability, among others.\n\nHowever, if you want to consider the cost / benefit ratio, Portugal is the place to look at.\n\nAccording with\n\nThe State of European Tech 2018\n\n,  the average software engineer salary per year in Lisbon is $31,500, while in Berlin is nearly 1.9x times higher ($58,750). In London the average is $54,000 and for our neighbours in Barcelona is $40,250.\n\nThe Portugal Wage Growth in Services is projected to trend around 2.60 percent in 2020 (by Trading Economics), which sets us still far below the leading European markets, such as UK and Germany.\n\nIn 2019, the Cost of Living Index ranks Portugal in the middle of chart (50th out of 119 countries), comparing favourably with Ireland (10\n\nth\n\n), UK (24\n\nth\n\n), France (11\n\nth\n\n), Slovenia (39\n\nth\n\n) and Spain (38\n\nth\n\n).\n\nAs you can see, Portugal offers a great value for money.\n\n4. European Leader in connectivity: accessibility and technological infrastructures\n\nWhen it comes to connectivity, nothing compares to us. According to\n\nEurope’s Digital Progress Report 2017 – Connectivity\n\n, Portugal is the leader in fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP) access in Europe, with almost 90% of the territory covered.\n\nPortugal is ranked 19 out of a pool of 138 countries by the\n\nGlobal Competitiveness index report 2018\n\nin quality of infrastructures, such as roads, telecommunications and internet access, and has one of the best internet velocities in the EU28 due to a focus on public investment.\n\nEurope’s Digital Progress Report (EDPR) 2017, Country Profile Portugal\n\n5. Strong social and political stability\n\nIt honours us to say that, Portugal is the 4\n\nth\n\nmost peaceful country in the world. This, according to the report Business & Peace 2018, acts as a good predictor of a country’s future performance in several macroeconomic indicators and our numbers reflects this statement.\n\nPortugal is a symbol of EU recovery. The GDP in Portugal expanded 2.10% in the third quarter of 2018 over the same quarter of the previous year. This year, the GDP annual growth rate is expected to be 2.20% by the end of the first quarter, according to\n\nTrading Economics\n\nglobal macro models and analysts’ expectations.\n\nThese numbers are also reflected by the amazing progress of the labour market. In fact, between 2014 and 2017, the number of jobs grew by over 351,000, which represents an average annual growth of 1.9%, slightly higher than the average GDP growth of 1.8% in the same period.\n\nPortugal Unemployment Rate Forecast\n\nWrapping up\n\nAlthough the global market might seem swamped in outsourcing options, finding the perfect development team for your project can be harder than expected. Portugal meets all the requirements – great talent, location, competitiveness and social, political and regulatory framework – to be seriously considered one of the most competitive nearshore outsourcing destinations. World-class businesses like Accenture, Altran, Cisco, Google, Microsoft, Nokia Siemens or SAP, already have highly successful nearshore operations in Portugal.\n\nWhat about you?

    "content": "Time management means a lot to us. Considering that much of the work we do is on a Team-as-a-service basis, we have to be proficient at managing our time.\n\nI realized that we spend a huge chunk of our time communicating. And one way or another, communication is responsible – directly or indirectly – for a large part of our days. Directly, because timely communication can save us important minutes (or hours). Indirectly, because the quality of communication impacts the information passed along, which will then affect the time we have to spend on each issue.\n\nBazzinga! That’s it! Communication in a team is the fundamental step to have a focused and productive team, that will develop faster!\n\nMany times, we just go to the person we need to communicate to and throw at her a huge amount of information. Doing that we stop whatever that person was doing. We take them out of their course or remove them from focus. That’s because our default type of\n\ncommunication is synchronous\n\n. We are used to it. Usually, when we need to ask something to someone we just interrupt her. Or we need to tell something, no matter how trivial, and we call the person to let her know. But there’s also another way: asynchronous communication and, at Near Partner, we try to use it a lot.\n\nSynchronous, asynchronous… say whaaat?\n\nLet me explain 😀\n\nSynchronous communication\n\nTo communicate synchronously means that both persons have to be available at the same time. Whenever we are scheduling a meeting we are validating if the other person (or persons) are available to share time and space with us. When we talk to someone, we are also communicating synchronously.\n\nWhat we are not always aware is that whenever we are invading someone else’s space and time two things can happen:\n\nThat person might not be available to have a conversation with us. Even if she answers back her mind might not be there. Her answers or statements could be a light-hearted version of their thoughts and the communication is not as fruitful as it might be.\n\nThe person might be doing something important that needs focus -some deep thought. When we interrupt that person, she might lose track of her reasoning. That means that in order to go back to where she was she will have to start the thought process all over again.\n\nIt’s a lose-lose situation. The person interrupting is not having her questions answered; the person who was interrupted was pulled out of her work.\n\nHow do we solve this?\n\nTo improve on these situations, we try to make all the team aware of the above-mentioned risks. It’s important that whoever needs to begin a conversation understands that the interlocutor might not be available to have the conversation. On the other hand, it’s important that no one feels obliged to answer a question when she is immersed in some kind of reasoning, or to engage in a conversation that she is not available to have. People must feel it’s ok to say, “I can’t right now”.\n\nTo make it easier, we try to follow two rules when communicating:\n\n– We don’t take it personally;\n\n– We don’t assume things from other people’s words.\n\nIt’s easier when it’s explicit what to expect.\n\nSo, when anyone is starting a conversation, it’s a good practice to:\n\n– Send a message using an internal messaging app, asking for time from the person she wants to talk to;\n\n– Inform the other person about the topic of the conversation – so the other can also participate in the decision on how urgent or important the issue is;\n\n– If it can wait, fall back to an asynchronous type of communication – message or email;\n\n– In case of emergency, then interrupt the person and talk directly.\n\nIf we’re on the other end as receptor of the communication, we should:\n\n– answer about the availability to have the conversation immediately;\n\n– if we are in the middle of an activity, only answer to urgent matters;\n\n– if we can’t answer right away or have to reply negatively, try to do it ASAP.\n\nObviously, this does not mean that we only have conversations about urgent matters. There are many topics which are easier to discuss on a one-to-one conversation than through chat messages. Whenever that happens, one way is to break the chat cycle: “let’s talk, it’s easier” or “let’s get together at 2pm to talk”.\n\nPhone calls!\n\nIt’s important to keep in mind that phone calls are also a type of synchronous communication. If you’re either making a phone call or receiving one, it’s important to act accordingly.\n\nWhenever you’re calling someone, make sure it’s important to have the conversation synchronously, at that time. If it’s important and the other person does not pick up, send a message with the general topic and how urgent you think it is. Only call repeatedly if it’s really an urgent matter. There’s nothing more annoying than getting out of a meeting to take a phone call by someone who has been calling repeatedly just to find out it’s just a mundane issue – unless it’s your mother calling, obviously! ?\n\nAsynchronous communication\n\nWhen I use email,\n\nSlack\n\nor any other messaging tool, that’s a way not to interfere with the time management of the rest of the team. I can ask now, you can answer whenever it suits you. There are many advantages to this. Even to me.\n\nIt gives me more time to think about the issue. I can validate things with others involved or I can check for myself. Truth is, sometimes I can even get to the answer alone – and the email ends up being a “this is the result / answer to this issue, right?”\n\nOne of the other advantages is that not only the communication is asynchronous, but it can be in group. Particularly if it happens in a chat room, I can ask the same question to several people. This means that if the subject needs some debate, I can even gain with the exchange.\n\nAlso, on a chat room, I can even launch some topic for discussion even if I don’t know who the best person to answer is.\n\nSo, let’s just communicate via email…\n\nObviously, this does not mean we should only communicate asynchronously. There are emotional aspects of a conversation which are very difficult to include in an email. It’s important to have in mind that, when sending an email, the other person is not “listening” or “seeing” me. Beware when using sarcasm or irony. It’s not easy to fine tune those in an email.\n\nOn the same note, if I’m receiving an email, I have to consider that the tone might not be the one I’m considering. Let’s not assume and give the sender a break…\n\nKnowing this, it’s important to consider some tips about email communication:\n\n– avoid too many exclamation or question marks – “???” and “!!!” are very easily misinterpreted;\n\n– use smiles – make the conversation smoother and easier to be read;\n\n– there are several words or sentences which are much harsher written than spoken – take that into account when writing (or reading) an email;\n\n– don’t use irony or sarcasm in emails – or at least be aware of the potential consequences;\n\n– be as clear and concise as possible – even if it takes longer and gives you an extra work crafting the message you’re sending.\n\nJust to recap…\n\nObviously, this does not mean that we should just use asynchronous communication tools. There are some messages that are better passed on via emails and others that are better in a conversation.\n\nAlso, we would be very dull people if we only would talk according to pre-established rules. There’s room for surprises, laughter and happiness in our communication.\n\nWe always have to choose. As we choose the words and the topics we want to discuss we also have to choose the medium through which to communicate with others.\n\nNowadays there’s a usual trend:\n\n“Less discussion by email, more discussion through chats and other communication tools.”\n\nOur answer?\n\n“Not so fast.\n\n“\n\nIt is important to consider the time we are taking from others. It’s also our job to make the communication with others as efficient as possible. And sometimes the good old email is a great way to do it.\n\nWhat do you think about this issue? Do you relate with it? Share some tips with us! There’s always room for improvement\n\n?",

    "content": "Welcome to Near Partner Blog. It’s great to have you here.\n\nMany times we said things like: “Hey, why don’t we share this with anyone else? Why just talk about it between us?” That’s why, instead of just keeping these conversations for ourselves, we’ve decided to “go public” and share some of those thoughts in this blog!\n\nSince you’re here, let me tell you what you can expect from our blog. Here we will write about our technical work and we’ll let you know a little bit about us and our team.\n\nEvery once and a while people ask us about the holy trinity: Vision, Mission and Values. So, if we are introducing ourselves, let’s take that out of the way. We believe that, many times,\n\nthese credos are much ado about nothing\n\n. That said, it’s not very likely for you to see on our website (or this blog, for that matter) a statement of those. Does this mean we don’t stand for anything? Nope. On the contrary. If you want to talk the talk you have to walk the walk. So, we prefer to let you know what we do and how we do it. From there, you will make your mind about what we actually stand for, every day. Who we are, not who we say we want to be.\n\nOn our blog you will be able to learn about the methodologies we use on our projects. Yes,\n\nwe are fans of agile\n\n. Not for agile sake, but because we have experienced first-hand the pros and cons. We have been delivering software and tech projects for a while now. For us, agile methodologies are the means, not the goal. Don’t expect orthodoxy in implementing Scrum “by the book”. Sometimes it makes sense. Sometimes it doesn’t. We check each project as unique and act accordingly.\n\nTechnology-wise we are agnostics. Hopefully, our posts reflect it 😉\n\nThis does not mean every programming language is the same. Nor that you can flip a coin to decide what tools you will use on each project. It means we value more the result than the technologies we use to get there. While choosing the technology to use we have to consider many factors. There’s the client, the project, the objectives or the type of application intended.\n\nThe client already has systems and applications using some old-school language? We will abide to that. Are there known hurdles in the way that lean us towards some type of solution? We must discuss the problem with the client.\n\nWe value the comfort and happiness of our team. We have the brightest minds working with us. We must treat them as such. Responsible people should have the liberty to make their own decisions. We think that will be self-evident from our posts. From time to time, you will have to excuse us for our vanity in showing our satisfaction. We don’t show off to cause envy – it’s pure and innocent joy that we want to share with you.\n\nIf we laugh and play, does that conflict with our effectiveness and professionalism? Not at all. We value productivity and efficiency. We work hard, and we play hard. And our clients thank us for the result of that 😀\n\nAs with everything, this is funnier with you. We hope you can join the conversation. Let us know how you feel.",

    "content": "I started my career as an administrative and shortly afterwards I was recruiting people for an outsourcing IT agency. It wasn’t an easy job and my degree didn’t give me all the tools I needed to do it seamlessly. At the time I didn’t know how to properly interview people, manage their expectations or how to face the lack of qualified people in the market. But, as always, it was a question of time and experience to get better every day.\n\nFew months later, I was delivering profiles like a pro. But this is all did. Match my client’s needs to candidates’ profiles.\n\nA year passed, and I accepted a new challenge. I began working as an Internal IT Recruiter for\n\nNear Partner\n\nand I didn’t know how much different the job was. I was in charge of recruiting all the team from scratch. This included searching, matching needs, interviewing, referring to technical validation and ensuring that all this process ran smoothly. Welcoming newbies also became a task and a privilege!\n\nSuddenly, it wasn’t a staffing job – like previously – I was interviewing and hiring the most qualified developers in the market at the time. I discovered a world apart.\n\nAs you can see, I bumped into a lot more\n\ndifferences between agency and in-house recruiting\n\nthan I expected. That’s why I decided to share some thoughts on what developers can expect from us – recruiters, and what we recruiters expect from you – developers. Curious? Follow me!\n\nWhat developers expect from an IT Recruiter\n\nTo be totally honest, I’m not 100% certain about what developers expect! I’m not inside your heads but let me share with you my experience.\n\nDevelopers have expectations. Nowadays, being a developer (or working in the IT industry) is like a super power and you all know that. So, developers have a big leverage when they are looking to embrace a new challenge. They’re looking for innovative projects, flexible hours, companies with smart people and a good work environment.\n\nFrom my experience, developers expect more than just another place to work: they want a cauldron of good humor, technical challenges and, obviously, a competitive salary package. People look for innovative projects because we all want to see the impact of our work. At the same time, developers want a good work-life balance, which is why we run the extra mile to make sure we provide the tools and conditions needed to achieve that.\n\nThe big “I”: the interview\n\nIn the early years of my career I felt confident interviewing: I followed a technical guide with questions about architecture, differences between programming languages and other foolish questions.\n\nLet me say… I’ve learned many things, but I quickly understood that it was silly. Developers didn’t expect that a HR manager, without any engineering knowledge, would be able to validate their technical skills.\n\nThat is why developers, architects or analysts must only expect from an IT recruiter to tell them what the company does, what its needs are and how they can work together.\n\nSo, my job is to understand their journeys and what are their soft skills, letting the hard ones for the big guns! My mission is to deliver a candidate with principles and all technical requirements. Leading the recruitment process smoothly with honesty and transparency from both sides is, for me, a basic principle.\n\nAt the end of the recruitment process, whatever the end, you must feel that you’ve learned something.\n\nThat’s why you should always assume you’ll receive some feedback from the company you interviewed for – it doesn’t mean sending a standard “Thank you” message! And, if you felt the urge, share your thoughts and feelings about the company or projects you have applied. We have received many interesting feedbacks along the way!\n\nWhat recruiters expect from a developer\n\nWorking in HR takes a special type of person: a people’s person. This means that they must be lovable, patient and very available.\n\nHowever, this is a two-way street. We recruiters expect nothing but respect and sincerity from the candidates. In a time when the supply of talent is so much lower than the needs, we encounter a lot of candidates who take advantage of this situation. Not in a good way.\n\nSo, let’s start for the basic of expectations:\n\nHonesty and respect in every interaction;\n\nOn the other hand, we hope we can get:\n\nSome availability to talk and eventually for an interview;\n\nSomeone with an interesting story;\n\nSomeone who fulfills all the technical requirements;\n\nSome other introductions that will help me find new suitable candidates;\n\nAcknowledgment that the interaction was fruitful;\n\nSumming up… what can developers expect from “me”?\n\nProactive attitude and smart questions;\n\nFollow-up during the process;\n\nAnd always an honest feedback;\n\nSo far, I have been very successful with this approach. I guess most of the developers I talk to agree with me. This also means that what we value as a company is aligned with what the people we talk to think is important.\n\nWhat about you? Do you agree with me? What do you expect from an IT recruiter? Share your opinion with us.",
